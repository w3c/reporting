Abstract:
  This document defines a generic reporting framework which allows web
  developers to associate a set of named reporting endpoints with an origin.
  Various platform features (like Content Security Policy, Network Error
  Reporting, and others) will use these endpoints to deliver feature-specific
  reports in a consistent manner.

  <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

  [INTRODUCTION GOES HERE]

  <h3 id="guarantees">Guarantees</h3>

  This specification aims to provide a best-effort report delivery system that
  executes out-of-band with website activity. The user agent will be able to do
  a better job prioritizing and scheduling delivery of reports, as it has an
  overview of cross-origin activity that individual websites do not, and can
  deliver reports based on error conditions that would prevent a website from
  loading in the first place.

  The delivery is not, however, guaranteed in a strict sense. We spell out a
  reasonable set of retry rules in the algorithms below, but it's quite possible
  for a report to be dropped on the floor if things go badly.

  Reporting can generate a good deal of traffic, so we allow developers to set
  up groups of <a>endpoints</a> in order to distribute load. Each of these
  endpoints will receive a subset of the generated reports which target that
  group. The user agent will do its best to deliver a particular report to
  <strong>at most one</strong> endpoint in a group. That is, reports will not
  fan-out to all the endpoints in a group, but the user agent will attempt
  delivery to one endpoint, and fallback to another upon failure.

  <h3 id="examples">Examples</h3>

  <div class="example">
    MegaCorp Inc. wants to collect Content Security Policy and Key Pinning
    violation reports. It can do so by delivering the following header to
    define a set of reporting endpoints named "`endpoint-1`":

    <pre>
      <a>Report-To</a>: { "<a>url</a>": "https://example.com/reports",
                          "<a>group</a>": "endpoint-1",
                          "<a>max-age</a>": 10886400 },
                 { "<a>url</a>": "https://backup.com/reports",
                   "<a>group</a>": "endpoint-1",
                   "<a>max-age</a>": 10886400 }
    </pre>

    And the following headers, which direct CSP and HPKP reports to that group:

    <pre>
      <a>Content-Security-Policy</a>: ...; <a lt="reports directive">report-to</a>=endpoint-1
      <a>Public-Key-Pins</a>: ...; report-to=endpoint-1
    </pre>
  </div>

  <div class="example">
    After processing reports for a little while, MegaCorp Inc. decides to split
    the processing of these two types of reports out into two distinct endpoints
    in order to make the processing scripts simpler. It can do so by delivering
    the following header to define two reporting endpoints:

    <pre>
      <a>Report-To</a>: { "<a>url</a>": "https://example.com/csp-reports",
                          "<a>group</a>": "csp-endpoint",
                          "<a>max-age</a>": 10886400 },
                 { "<a>url</a>": "https://example.com/hpkp-reports",
                   "<a>group</a>": "hpkp-endpoint",
                   "<a>max-age</a>": 10886400 }
    </pre>

    And the following headers, which direct CSP and HPKP reports to those named
    endpoint:

    <pre>
      <a>Content-Security-Policy</a>: ...; <a lt="reports directive">report-to</a>=csp-endpoint
      <a>Public-Key-Pins</a>: ...; report-to=hpkp-endpoint
    </pre>
  </div>

  <h2 id="concept">Concepts</h2>

  <h3 id="concept-endpoints">Endpoints</h3>

  An <dfn export>endpoint</dfn> is location to which <a>reports</a> may be sent.

  Each <a>endpoint</a> has a <dfn for="endpoint" export attribute>url</dfn>,
  which is a {{URL}}.

  Each <a>endpoint</a> has a
  <dfn for="endpoint" export attribute>failures</dfn>, which is a non-negative
  integer representing the number of consecutive times this endpoint has failed
  to respond to a request.

  Each <a>endpoint</a> has a
  <dfn for="endpoint" export attribute>retry-after</dfn>, which is either
  `null`, or a timestamp after which delivery should be retried.

  Each <a>endpoint</a> has a <dfn for="endpoint" export attribute>clients</dfn>
  list, which is a list of <a>clients</a>.

  An <a>endpoint</a> is <dfn for="endpoint" id="endpoint-expired">expired</dfn>
  if every <a>client</a> in its list of {{endpoint/clients}} is
  <a for="client">expired</a>.

  An <a>endpoint</a> is <dfn for="endpoint">pending</dfn> if its
  {{endpoint/retry-after}} is not `null`, and represents a time in the future.

  <h3 id="concept-client">Clients</h3>

  A <dfn export>client</dfn> represents a particular origin's relationship to
  an <a>endpoint</a>.

  Each <a>client</a> has an <dfn for="client" export attribute>origin</dfn>,
  which is an <a>origin</a>.

  Each <a>client</a> has a <dfn for="client" export attribute>subdomains</dfn>
  flag (which is either "`include`" or "`exclude`").

  Each <a>client</a> has a <dfn for="client" export attribute>group</dfn> which
  is an ASCII string.

  Each <a>client</a> has a <dfn for="client" export attribute>ttl</dfn>
  representing the the number of seconds the client remains valid for an
  <a>endpoint</a>.

  Each <a>client</a> has a <dfn for="client" export attribute>creation</dfn>
  which is the timestamp at which the client was added to an <a>endpoint</a>.

  A <a>client</a> is <dfn for="client" id="client-expired">expired</dfn> if its
  {{client/creation}} plus its {{client/ttl}} represents a time in the past.

  <h3 id="concept-reports">Reports</h3>

  A <dfn export>report</dfn> is a collection of arbitrary data which the user
  agent is expected to deliver to a specified endpoint.

  Each <a>report</a> has a <dfn for="report" export attribute>body</dfn>,
  which is either `null` or an object which can be serialized into a <a>JSON
  text</a>.

  Each <a>report</a> has an <dfn for="report" export attribute>url</dfn>,
  which is the address of the `Document` or `Worker` from which the report was
  generated.

  Note: We strip the username, password, and fragment from this serialized URL.
  See [[#capability-urls]].

  Each <a>report</a> has an <dfn for="report" export attribute>origin</dfn>,
  which is an <a>origin</a> representing the report's initiator.

  Each <a>report</a> has an <dfn for="report" export attribute>group</dfn>,
  which is a string representing the {{client/group}} to which this report
  will be sent.

  Each <a>report</a> has a <dfn for="report" export attribute>type</dfn>,
  which is a non-empty string specifying the type of data the report contains.

  Each <a>report</a> has a <dfn for="report" export attribute>timestamp</dfn>,
  which records the time at which the report was generated, in milliseconds
  since the unix epoch.

  Each <a>report</a> has a <dfn for="report" export attribute>attempts</dfn>,
  which is a non-negative integer representing the number of times the user
  agent attempted to deliver the report.

  <h3 id="concept-storage">Storage</h3>

  A conformant user agent MUST provide a <dfn>reporting cache</dfn>, which
  is a storage mechanism that maintains a set of <a>endpoints</a> that websites
  have instructed the user agent to associate with their <a>origins</a>, and a
  set of <a>reports</a> which are queued for delivery.

  This storage mechanism is opaque, vendor-specific, and not exposed to the
  web, but it MUST provide the following methods which will be used in the
  algorithms this document defines:

  1.  Insert, update, and remove <a>endpoints</a>.
  2.  Enqueue and dequeue <a>reports</a> for delivery.
  3.  Retrieve a list of <a>endpoint</a> objects.
  4.  Retrieve a list of queued <a>report</a> objects.
  5.  Clear the cache.
</section>

<section>
  <h2 id="endpoint-delivery">Endpoint Delivery</h2>

  A server MAY define a set of reporting endpoints for an origin it controls
  via the <a>`Report-To`</a> HTTP response header field. This mechanism
  is defined in [[#header]], and its processing in [[#process-header]].

  <h3 id="header">The `Report-To` HTTP Response Header Field</h3>

  The <dfn export>`Report-To`</dfn> HTTP response header field instructs the
  user agent to store reporting endpoints for an origin. The header is
  represented by the following ABNF grammar [[!RFC5234]]:

  <pre class="abnf" link-type="grammar" dfn-type="grammar">
    Report-To = <a>json-field-value</a>
                ; See Section 2 of [[HTTP-JFV]], and Section 2 of [[RFC7159]]
  </pre>

  The header's value is interpreted as an array of JSON objects, as described in
  Section 4 of [[HTTP-JFV]].

  Each object in the array defines an <a>endpoint</a> to which reports may be
  delivered, and will be parsed as defined in [[#parse-header]].

  The following subsections defined the initial set of known members in each
  JSON object the header's value defines. Future versions of this document may
  define additional such members, and user agents MUST ignore unknown members
  when parsing the header.

  <h4 id="url-member">The `url` member</h4>

  The REQUIRED <dfn>`url`</dfn> member is a string that defines the location
  of a reporting endpoint. The member's value MUST be a string; any other type
  will result in a parse error.

  Moreover, the URL that the member's value represents MUST be <a>potentially
  trustworthy</a> [[!SECURE-CONTEXTS]]. Non-secure endpoints will be ignored.

  <h4 id="id-member">The `group` member</h4>

  The OPTIONAL <dfn>`group`</dfn> member is a string that associates a name with
  the reporting endpoint. The member's value MUST be a string; any other type
  will result in a parse error. If no member named "`group`" is present in the
  object, the <a>endpoint</a> will be associated with a group named "`default`".

  The group name is not unique and multiple endpoints may use the same name to
  create a set of reporting endpoints that can be used for backup and failover
  purposes. If the member is omitted, the endpoint MUST be associated with
  the "default" group name.

  Note: If a group resolves to multiple <a>endpoints</a>, the user agent will
  deliver a particular <a>report</a> to <strong>at most one</strong>
  <a>endpoint</a> in that group on a best-effort basis.

  <h4 id="includesubdomains-member">The `includeSubdomains` member</h4>

  The OPTIONAL <dfn>`includeSubdomains`</dfn> member is a boolean that enables
  an endpoint for all subdomains of the current <a>origin</a>'s {{URL/host}}.
  If no member named "`includeSubdomains`" is present in the object, or its
  value is not "`true`", the endpoint will not be enabled for subdomains.

  <h4 id="max-age-member">The `max-age` member</h4>

  The REQUIRED <dfn export>`max-age`</dfn> member defines the reporting endpoint's
  lifetime, as a non-negative integer number of seconds. The member's value MUST
  be a number; any other type will result in a parse error.

  A value of "`0`" will cause the <a>endpoint</a> to be removed from the user
  agent's <a>reporting cache</a>.

  <h3 id="process-header" algorithm>
    Process reporting endpoints for |response| to |request|
  </h3>

  Given a <a>response</a> (|response|) and a <a>request</a> (|request|), this
  algorithm extracts a list of <a>endpoint</a> objects, and updates the
  <a>reporting cache</a> accordingly.

  Note: This algorithm is called from around step 13 of <a>main fetch</a>
  [[FETCH]], and only updates the <a>reporting cache</a> if the |response|
  has been delivered securely.

  ISSUE: Fetch monkey patching. Talk to Anne.

  1.  Abort these steps if any of the following conditions are true:

      1.  |response|'s <a for="response" attribute>HTTPS state</a> is not
          "`modern`", and the <a lt="origin of a url">origin</a> of |response|'s
          <a for="response" attribute>url</a> is not <a>potentially
          trustworthy</a>.

      2.  |response|'s <a for="response" attribute>header list</a> does not
          contain a <a>header</a> whose <a for="header" attribute>name</a> is
          "<a>`Report-To`</a>".

  2.  Let |header| be the <a for="header" attribute>value</a> of the
      <a>header</a> in |response|'s <a for="response" attribute>header list</a>
      whose name is "<a>`Report-To`</a>".

  3.  Let |origin| be the <a lt="origin of a url">origin</a> of |response|'s
      <a for="response" attribute>url</a>.

  4.  Let |tuples| be the result of executing [[#parse-header]] on |header|.

  5.  For each |tuple| in |tuples|:

      1.  Let |new| be a new <a>client</a> whose properties are set as follows:

          :   {{client/origin}}
          ::  |origin|
          :   {{client/subdomains}}
          ::  |tuple|'s {{client/subdomains}}
          :   {{client/group}}
          ::  |tuple|'s {{client/group}}
          :   {{client/ttl}}
          ::  |tuple|'s {{client/ttl}}
          :   {{client/creation}}
          ::  The current timestamp

      2.  If there exists an <a>endpoint</a> (|endpoint|) in the <a>reporting
          cache</a> whose {{endpoint/url}} is |tuple|'s {{URL}}:

          1.  For each |client| in |endpoint|'s {{endpoint/clients}}, delete
              |client| if |new|'s {{client/origin}} is the same as |client|'s
              {{client/origin}}.

          2.  If |new|'s {{client/ttl}} is greater than 0, append |new| to
              |endpoint|'s {{endpoint/clients}} list.

          3.  Skip to the next |tuple|.

      3.  Otherwise, there is no existing <a>endpoint</a>, so let |endpoint|
          be a new <a>endpoint</a> whose properties are set as follows:

          :   {{endpoint/url}}
          ::  |tuple|'s {{URL}}
          :   {{endpoint/failures}}
          ::  0
          :   {{endpoint/retry-after}}
          ::  `null`
          :   {{endpoint/clients}}
          ::  A new list, containing |tuple|

      4.  Insert |endpoint| into the <a>reporting cache</a> for |origin|.

  <h3 id="parse-header" algorithm>
    Parse reporting endpoint tuples from |value|
  </h3>

  Given a string (|value|) this algorithm will return a list of tuples
  containing a {{URL}}, {{client/subdomains}} flag, {{client/ttl}}, and a
  {{client/group}}. This list will be empty if no valid endpoints could be
  parsed.

  1.  Let |list| be the result of executing the algorithm defined in Section 4
      of [[HTTP-JFV]]. If that algorithm results in an error, abort these steps.

  2.  Let |tuples| be an empty list.

  3.  For each |item| in |list|:

      1.  If |item| has no member named "<a>`url`</a>", or that member's value
          is not a string, skip to the next |item|.

      2.  If |item| has no member named "<a>`max-age`</a>", or that member's
          value is not a number, skip to the next |item|.

      3.  Let |tuple| be a new tuple containing the following:

          :   "`url`"
          ::  The result of executing the <a>URL parser</a> on |item|'s
              "<a>`url`</a>" member's value.
          :   "`subdomains`"
          ::  "`Include`" if |item| has a member named
              "<a>`includeSubdomains`</a>" whose value is `true`, "`Exclude`"
              otherwise.
          :   "`ttl`"
          ::  |item|'s "<a>`max-age`</a>" member's value.
          :   "`group`"
          ::  |item|'s "<a>`group`</a>" member's value if present, and
              "`default`" otherwise.

      4.  If |tuple|'s "`url`" is not <a>potentially trustworthy</a>, or
          |tuple|'s "`ttl`" is a negative number, skip to the next |item|.

          Note: User agents SHOULD raise some sort of developer-visible parse
          error in this case.

      5.  Append |tuple| to |tuples|.

  4.  Return |tuples|.

  <h2 id="report-delivery">Report Delivery</h2>

  Over time, various features will queue up a list of <a>reports</a> in the
  user agent's <a>reporting cache</a>. The user agent will periodically grab
  the list of currently pending reports, and deliver them to the associated
  endpoints. This document does not define a schedule for the user agent to
  follow, and assumes that the user agent will have enough contextual
  information to deliver reports in a timely manner, balanced against impacting
  a user's experience.

  That said, a user agent SHOULD make a effort to deliver reports as soon as
  possible after queuing, as a report's data might be significantly more useful
  in the period directly after its generation than it would be a day or a week
  later.

  <h3 id="queue-report" algorithm>
    Queue |data| as |type| for |endpoint group| on |settings|
  </h3>

  Given a serializable object (|data|), a string (|type|), another string
  (|endpoint group|), and an <a>environment settings object</a> (|settings|),
  the following algorithm will create a <a>report</a>, and add it to
  <a>reporting cache</a>'s queue for future delivery.

  1.  Let |report| be a new <a>report</a> object with its values initialized as
      follows:

      :   {{report/body}}
      ::  |data|
      :   {{report/origin}}
      ::  |settings|'s <a>origin</a>
      :   {{report/group}}
      ::  |endpoint group|
      :   {{report/type}}
      ::  |type|
      :   {{report/timestamp}}
      ::  The current timestamp.
      :   {{report/attempts}}
      ::  0

  2.  Let |url| be |settings|'s <a>creation URL</a>.

  3.  Set |url|'s {{URL/username}} to the empty string, and its {{URL/password}}
      to `null`.

  4.  Set |report|'s {{report/url}} to the result of executing the <a>URL
      serializer</a> on |url| with the <em>exclude fragment flag</em> set.

  5.  Add |report| to the <a>reporting cache</a>.

  Note: We strip the username, password, and fragment from the serialized URL
  in the report. See [[#capability-urls]].

  Note: The user agent MAY reject reports for any reason. This API does not
  guarantee delivery of arbitrary amounts of data, for instance.

  <h3 id="does-endpoint-match-report">
    Does |endpoint| match |report|?
  </h3>

  Given an <a>endpoint</a> (|endpoint|) and a <a>report</a> (|report|), this
  algorithm returns "`Match`" if |report| should be sent to |endpoint|, and
  "`Does Not Match`" otherwise:

  1.  For each |client| in |endpoint|'s {{endpoint/clients}}:

      1.  If |client| is <a for="client">expired</a>, skip to the next |client|.

          Note: In this case, the user agent MAY remove |client| from
          |endpoint|, or it may wait and collect garbage <i lang="fr">en
          masse</i> at some point in the future as described in [[#gc]].

      2.  Return "`Match`" if each of the following criteria is met:

          1.  |report|'s {{report/group}} is an <a>ASCII case-insensitive</a>
              match for |client|'s {{client/group}}

          2.  If |client|'s {{client/subdomains}} is "`exclude`", |report|'s
              {{report/origin}} is the same as |client|'s {{client/origin}}

              Otherwise, |report|'s {{report/origin}}'s {{URL/host}} is either a
              <a>superdomain match</a> or <a>congruent match</a> for |client|'s
              {{client/origin}}'s {{URL/host}} [[!RFC6797]]

  2.  Return "`Does Not Match`".

  <h3 id="send-reports" algorithm>
    Send reports
  </h3>

  A user agent sends reports by executing the following steps:

  1.  Let |reports| be a copy of the list of queued <a>report</a> objects in
      <a>reporting cache</a>.

  2.  Let |endpoint map| be an empty map of <a>endpoint</a> objects to lists of
      <a>report</a> objects.

  3.  For each |report| in |reports|:

      1.  For |endpoint| in the <a>reporting cache</a>:

          1.  If |endpoint| is <a for="endpoint">expired</a>, skip to the next
              |endpoint|.

              Note: In this case, the user agent MAY remove |endpoint| from the
              <a>reporting cache</a>, or it may wait and collect garbage
              <i lang="fr">en masse</i> at some point in the future as described
              in [[#gc]].

          2.  If |endpoint| is <a for="endpoint">pending</a>, skip to the next
              |endpoint|.

          3.  If [[#does-endpoint-match-report]] returns "`Match`" when executed
              upon |endpoint| and |report|:

              1.  Append |report| to |endpoint map|'s list of reports for
                  |endpoint|.

              2.  Skip to the next |report|.

                  Note: This ensures that each report is assigned to a single
                  endpoint, even if it matches multiple. In order to ensure
                  an even distribution across endpoints, the user agent SHOULD
                  randomize the order in which it walks through endpoints.

      2.  If we reach this step, the |report| did not match any <a>endpoint</a>
          and the user agent MAY remove |report| from the <a>reporting cache</a>
          directly. Depending on load, the user agent MAY instead wait for
          [[#gc]] at some point in the future.

  4.  For each (|endpoint|, |reports|) pair in |endpoint map|, execute the
      following steps asynchronously:

      1.  Let |result| be the result of executing [[#try-delivery]] on
          |endpoint| and |reports|.

      2.  If |result| is "`Success`":

          1.  Set |endpoint|'s {{endpoint/failures}} to 0, and its
              {{endpoint/retry-after}} to `null`.

          2.  Remove each <a>report</a> in |reports| from the <a>reporting
              cache</a>.

          Otherwise:

          1.  Increment |endpoint|'s {{endpoint/failures}}.

          2.  Set |endpoint|'s {{endpoint/retry-after}} to a point in the future
              which the user agent chooses.

              Note: We don't specify a particular algorithm here, but user
              agents are encouraged to employ some sort of exponential backoff
              algorithm which increases the retry period with the number of
              failures, with the addition of some random jitter to ensure that
              temporary failures don't lead to a crush of reports all being
              retried on the same schedule.

              ISSUE: Add in a reasonable reference describing a good algorithm.
              Wikipedia, if nothing else.

  Note: User agents MAY decide to attempt delivery for only a subset of the
  collected reports or endpoints (because, for example, sending all the reports
  at once would consume an unreasonable amount of bandwidth, etc). As reports
  are only removed from the cache when they're successfully delivered, skipped
  reports will simply be delivered later.

  <h3 id="try-delivery" algorithm>
    Attempt to deliver |reports| to |endpoint|
  </h3>

  Given a list of <a>reports</a> (|reports|) and an <a>endpoint</a>
  (|endpoint|), this algorithm will construct a <a>request</a>, and attempt to
  deliver it to |endpoint|. It returns "`Success`" if that delivery succeeds,
  "`Remove Endpoint`" if the endpoint explicitly removes itself as a reporting
  endpoint by sending a 410 response, and "`Failure`" otherwise.

  1.  Let |collection| be a new ECMAScript `Array` object [[!ECMA-262]].

  2.  For each |report| in |reports|:

      1.  Let |data| be a new ECMAScript `Object` with the following properties
          [[!ECMA-262]]:

          :   `age`
          ::  The number of milliseconds between |report|'s {{report/timestamp}}
              and the current time.
          :   `type`
          ::  |report|'s {{report/type}}
          :   `url`
          ::  |report|'s {{report/url}}
          :   `report`
          ::  |report|'s {{report/body}}

          Note: Client clocks are unreliable and subject to skew. We therefore
          deliver an `age` attribute rather than an absolute timestamp. See
          also [[#fingerprinting-clock-skew]]

      2.  Increment |report|'s {{report/attempts}}.

      3.  Append |data| to |collection|.

  3.  Let |request| be a new <a>request</a> with the following properties
      [[FETCH]]:

      :   `url`
      ::  |endpoint|'s {{endpoint/url}}
      :   `header list`
      ::  A new <a>header list</a> containing a <a>header</a> named
          "`Content-Type`" whose value is "`application/report`"

      ::  `null`
      :   `window`
      ::  "`no-window`"
      :   `skip-service-worker` flag
      ::  Set.

      :   `body`
      ::  The string resulting from executing the {{JSON.stringify()}} algorithm
          on |collection| [[!ECMA-262]]

      ISSUE: The "`report`" type does not exist in Fetch. Talk to Anne.

  4.  <a>Queue a task</a> to <a>fetch</a> |request|.

  5.  <a>Wait for a response</a> (|response|).

  6.  If |response|'s `status` is an <a>OK status</a> (200-299), return
      "`Success`".

  7.  If |response|'s `status` is `410 Gone` [[!RFC7231]], return "`Remove
      Endpoint`".

  8.  Return "`Failure`".

  <h2 id="implementation">Implementation Considerations</h2>

  <h3 id="delivery">Delivery</h3>

  The user agent SHOULD attempt to deliver reports as soon as possible to
  provide feedback to developers as quickly as possible. However, when this
  desire is balanced against the impact on the user, the user wins. With that
  in mind, the user agent MAY delay delivery of reports based on its knowledge
  of the user's activities and context.

  For instance, the user agent SHOULD prioritize the transmission of reporting
  data lower than other network traffic. The user's explicit activities on a
  website should preempt reporting traffic.

  The user agent MAY choose to withhold report delivery entirely until the user
  is on a fast, cheap network in order to prevent unnecessary data cost.

  The user agent MAY choose to prioritize reports from particular origins over
  others (perhaps those that the user visits most often?)

  <h3 id="gc">Garbage Collection</h3>

  Periodically, the user agent SHOULD walk through the cached <a>reports</a>
  and <a>endpoints</a>, and discard those that are no longer relevant. These
  include:

  *   <a>endpoints</a> which are <a for="endpoint">expired</a>
  *   <a>endpoints</a> which have not been used in some arbitrary period of time
      (perhaps a ~week?)
  *   <a>endpoints</a> whose {{endpoint/failures}} exceed
      some user-agent-defined threshold (~5 seems reasonable)
  *   <a>reports</a> whose {{report/attempts}} exceed
      some user-agent-defined threshold (~5 seems reasonable)
  *   <a>reports</a> which have not been delivered in some arbitrary period of
      time (perhaps ~2 days?)

  <h2 id="security">Security Considerations</h2>

  <h3 id="capability-urls">Capability URLs</h3>

  Some URLs are valuable in and of themselves. To mitigate the possibility
  that such URLs will be leaked via this reporting mechanism, we strip out
  credential information and fragment data from the URL we store as a
  <a>report</a>'s originator. It is still possible, however, for a feature
  to unintentionally leak such data via a report's {{report/body}}. Implementers
  SHOULD ensure that URLs contained in a report's body are similarly stripped.
</section>

<section>
  <h2 id="privacy">Privacy Considerations</h2>

  <h3 id="network-leakage">Network Leakage</h3>

  Because this reporting mechanism is out-of-band, and doesn't rely on a page
  being open, it's entirely possible for a report generated while a user is on
  one network to be sent while the user is on another network, even if they
  don't explicitly open the page from which the report was sent.

  ISSUE(WICG/BackgroundSync#107): Consider mitigations. For example, we could
  drop reports if we change from one network to another.

  <h3 id="fingerprinting-clock-skew">Clock Skew</h3>

  Each report is delivered along with an `age` property, rather than the
  timestamp at which it was generated. We do this because each user's local
  clock will be skewed from the clock on the server by an arbitrary amount.
  The difference between the time the report was generated and the time it
  was sent will be stable, regardless of clock skew, and we can avoid the
  fingerprinting risk of exposing the clock skew via this API.

  <h3 id="correlation">Cross-origin correlation</h3>

  If multiple origins all use the same reporting endpoint, that endpoint may
  learn that a particular user has interacted with a certain set of websites,
  as it will receive origin-tagged reports from each. This doesn't seem worse
  than the status quo ability to track the same information from cooperative
  origins, and doesn't grant any new tracking ability above and beyond what's
  possible with `<img>` today.

  <h3 id="subdomains">Subdomains</h3>

  This specification allows any resource on a host to declare a set of reporting
  endpoints for that host and each of its subdomains. This doesn't have privacy
  implications in and of itself (beyond those noted in [[#clear-cache]]), as the
  reporting endpoints themselves don't take any real action, as features will
  need to opt-into using these reporting endpoints explicitly. Those features
  certainly will have privacy implications, and should carefully consider
  whether they should be enabled across origin boundaries.

  <h3 id="clear-cache">Clearing the reporting cache</h3>

  A user agent's <a>reporting cache</a> contains data about a user's activity
  on the web, and user agents ought to handle this data carefully. In
  particular, if a user agent gives users the ability to clear their site data,
  browsing history, browsing cache, or similar, the user agent MUST also clear
  the <a>reporting cache</a>. Note that this includes both the pending reports
  themselves, as well as the endpoints to which they would be sent. Both MUST
  be cleared.

  <h3 id="disable">Disabling Reporting</h3>

  Reporting is, to some extent, a question of commons. In the aggregate, it
  seems useful for everyone for reports to be delivered. There is direct benefit
  to developers, as they can fix bugs, which means there's indirect benefit to
  users, as the sites they enjoy will be more stable and enjoyable. As a
  concrete example, Content Security Policy grants something like herd immunity
  to cross-site scripting attacks by alerting developers about potential holes
  in their sites' defenses. Fixing those bugs helps every user, even those whose
  user agents don't support Content Security Policy.

  The calculus, of course, depends on the nature of data that's being delivered,
  and the relative maliciousness of the reporting endpoints, but that's the
  value proposition in broad strokes.

  That said, it can't be the case that this general benefit be allowed to take
  priority over the ability of a user to individually opt-out of such a system.
  Sending reports costs bandwidth, and potentially could reveal some small
  amount of additional information above and beyond what a website can obtain
  in-band ([[NETWORK-ERROR-LOGGING]], for instance). User agents MUST allow
  users to disable reporting with some reasonable amount of granularity in order
  to maintain the priority of constituencies espoused in
  [[HTML-DESIGN-PRINCIPLES]].
