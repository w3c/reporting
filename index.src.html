Abstract:
  This document defines a generic reporting framework which allows web
  developers to associate a set of named reporting endpoints with an origin.
  Various platform features (like Content Security Policy, Network Error
  Reporting, and others) will use these endpoints to deliver feature-specific
  reports in a consistent manner.

  <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

  [INTRODUCTION GOES HERE]

  <h3 id="guarantees">Guarantees</h3>

  This specification aims to provide a best-effort report delivery system that
  executes out-of-band with website activity. The user agent will be able to do
  a better job prioritizing and scheduling delivery of reports, as it has an
  overview of cross-origin activity that individual websites do not, and can
  deliver reports based on error conditions that would prevent a website from
  loading in the first place.

  The delivery is not, however, guaranteed in a strict sense. We spell out a
  reasonable set of retry rules in the algorithms below, but it's quite possible
  for a report to be dropped on the floor if things go badly.

  Reporting can generate a good deal of traffic, so we allow developers to set
  up groups of <a>endpoints</a>, using a failover and load-balancing mechanism
  inspired by the DNS <a>SRV record</a>.  The user agent will do its best to
  deliver a particular report to <strong>at most one</strong> endpoint in a
  group.  Endpoints can be assigned weights to distribute load, with each
  endpoint receiving a specified fraction of reporting traffic.  Endpoints can
  be assigned priorities, allowing developers to set up fallback collectors that
  are only tried when uploads to primary collectors fail.

  <h3 id="examples">Examples</h3>

  <div class="example">
    MegaCorp Inc. wants to collect Content Security Policy and Key Pinning
    violation reports. It can do so by delivering the following header to
    define a set of reporting endpoints named "`endpoint-1`":

    <pre>
      <a>Report-To</a>: { "<a for="ReportTo">group</a>": "endpoint-1",
                   "<a for="ReportTo">max_age</a>": 10886400,
                   "<a>endpoints</a>": [
                     { "<a for="ReportTo">url</a>": "https://example.com/reports", "<a for="ReportTo">priority</a>": 1 },
                     { "<a for="ReportTo">url</a>": "https://backup.com/reports", "<a for="ReportTo">priority</a>": 2 }
                   ] }
    </pre>

    And the following headers, which direct CSP and HPKP reports to that group:

    <pre>
      <a>Content-Security-Policy</a>: ...; <a lt="reports directive">report-to</a> endpoint-1
      <a>Public-Key-Pins</a>: ...; report-to=endpoint-1
    </pre>
  </div>

  <div class="example">
    After processing reports for a little while, MegaCorp Inc. decides to split
    the processing of these two types of reports out into two distinct endpoints
    in order to make the processing scripts simpler. It can do so by delivering
    the following header to define two reporting endpoints:

    <pre>
      <a>Report-To</a>: { "<a for="ReportTo">group</a>": "csp-endpoint",
                   "<a for="ReportTo">max_age</a>": 10886400,
                   "<a for="ReportTo">endpoints</a>": [
                     { "<a for="ReportTo">url</a>": "https://example.com/csp-reports" }
                   ] },
                 { "<a for="ReportTo">group</a>": "hpkp-endpoint",
                   "<a for="ReportTo">max_age</a>": 10886400,
                   "<a for="ReportTo">endpoints</a>": [
                     { "<a for="ReportTo">url</a>": "https://example.com/hpkp-reports" }
                   ] }
    </pre>

    And the following headers, which direct CSP and HPKP reports to those named
    endpoint:

    <pre>
      <a>Content-Security-Policy</a>: ...; <a lt="reports directive">report-to</a> csp-endpoint
      <a>Public-Key-Pins</a>: ...; report-to=hpkp-endpoint
    </pre>
  </div>

  <h2 id="concept">Concepts</h2>

  <h3 id="concept-client">Clients</h3>

  A <dfn export>client</dfn> represents a particular origin's relationship to
  a set of <a>endpoints</a>.

  Each <a>client</a> has an <dfn for="client" export attribute>origin</dfn>,
  which is an <a spec="html">origin</a>.

  Each <a>client</a> has an
  <dfn for="client" export attribute>endpoint-groups</dfn> list, which is a list
  of <a>endpoint groups</a>, each of which MUST have a distinct
  {{endpoint group/name}}.  (The algorithm in [[#process-header]] guarantees
  this by keeping the first entry in a `Report-To` header with a particular
  name.)

  <h3 id="concept-endpoint-groups">Endpoint groups</h3>

  An <dfn export>endpoint group</dfn> is a set of <a>endpoints</a> that will be
  used together for backup and failover purposes.

  Each <a>endpoint group</a> has a
  <dfn for="endpoint group" export attribute>name</dfn>, which is an ASCII
  string.

  Each <a>endpoint group</a> has an
  <dfn for="endpoint group" export attribute>endpoints</dfn> list, which is a
  list of <a>endpoints</a>.

  Each <a>endpoint group</a> has a
  <dfn for="endpoint group" export attribute>subdomains</dfn> flag, which is
  either "`include`" or "`exclude`".

  Each <a>endpoint group</a> has a
  <dfn for="endpoint group" export attribute>ttl</dfn> representing the
  number of seconds the group remains valid for an <a spec="html">origin</a>.

  Each <a>endpoint group</a> has a
  <dfn for="endpoint group" export attribute>creation</dfn> which is the
  timestamp at which the group was added to an <a spec="html">origin</a>.

  An <a>endpoint group</a> is
  <dfn for="endpoint group" id="endpoint-group-expired">expired</dfn> if its
  {{endpoint group/creation}} plus its {{endpoint group/ttl}} represents a time
  in the past.

  <h3 id="concept-endpoints">Endpoints</h3>

  An <dfn export>endpoint</dfn> is location to which <a>reports</a> for a
  particular <a spec="html">origin</a> may be sent.

  Each <a>endpoint</a> has a <dfn for="endpoint" export attribute>url</dfn>,
  which is a {{URL}}.

  Each <a>endpoint</a> has a <dfn for="endpoint" export
  attribute>priority</dfn>, which is a non-negative integer.

  Each <a>endpoint</a> has a <dfn for="endpoint" export attribute>weight</dfn>,
  which is a non-negative integer.

  Each <a>endpoint</a> has a
  <dfn for="endpoint" export attribute>failures</dfn>, which is a non-negative
  integer representing the number of consecutive times this endpoint has failed
  to respond to a request.

  Each <a>endpoint</a> has a
  <dfn for="endpoint" export attribute>retry_after</dfn>, which is either
  `null`, or a timestamp after which delivery should be retried.

  An <a>endpoint</a> is <dfn for="endpoint">pending</dfn> if its
  {{endpoint/retry_after}} is not `null`, and represents a time in the future.

  <h3 id="concept-report-type">Report Type</h3>

  A <dfn>report type</dfn> is a non-empty string that specifies the set of data
  that is contained in the [=report/body=] of a <a>report</a>.

  When a <a>report type</a> is defined (in this spec or others), it can be
  specified to be <dfn>visible to <code>ReportingObserver</code>s</dfn>, meaning
  that <a>reports</a> of that type can be observed by a <a>reporting
  observer</a>. By default, <a>report types</a> are not <a>visible to
  <code>ReportingObserver</code>s</a>.

  Note: See [[#deprecation-report]] as an example <a>report type</a> definition.

  <h3 id="concept-reports">Reports</h3>

  A <dfn export>report</dfn> is a collection of arbitrary data which the user
  agent is expected to deliver to a specified endpoint.

  Each <a>report</a> has a <dfn for="report" export>body</dfn>, which is either
  `null` or an object which can be serialized into a <a>JSON text</a>. The
  fields contained in a <a>report</a>'s [=report/body=] are determined by
  the <a>report</a>'s [=report/type=].

  Each <a>report</a> has a <dfn for="report" export>url</dfn>, which
  is typically the address of the `Document` or `Worker` from which the report
  was generated.

  Note: We strip the username, password, and fragment from this serialized URL.
  See [[#capability-urls]].

  Each <a>report</a> has a <dfn for="report" export>user agent</dfn>, which is
  the value of the <code>User-Agent</code> <a>header</a> of the <a>request</a>
  from which the report was generated.

  Note: The <a for="report">user agent</a> of a <a>report</a> represents the
  <code>User-Agent</code> sent by the browser for the page which generated the
  <a>report</a>.  This is potentially distinct from the <code>User-Agent</code>
  sent in the HTTP headers when uploading the report to a collector — for
  instance, where the browser has chosen to use a non-default
  <code>User-Agent</code> string such as the "request desktop site" feature.

  Each <a>report</a> has a <dfn for="report" export>group</dfn>,
  which is a string representing the {{endpoint group/name}} of the
  <a spec="html">origin</a>'s <a>endpoint group</a> that the report will be sent
  to.

  Each <a>report</a> has a <dfn for="report" id="report-reporttype"
  export>type</dfn>, which is a <a>report type</a>.

  Each <a>report</a> has a <dfn for="report" export>timestamp</dfn>,
  which records the time at which the report was generated, in milliseconds
  since the unix epoch.

  Each <a>report</a> has an <dfn for="report" export>attempts</dfn>
  counter, which is a non-negative integer representing the number of times the
  user agent attempted to deliver the report.

  <h3 id="concept-storage">Storage</h3>

  A conformant user agent MUST provide a <dfn>reporting cache</dfn>, which
  is a storage mechanism that maintains a set of <a>endpoint groups</a> that
  websites have instructed the user agent to associate with their
  <a spec="html">origins</a>, and a set of <a>reports</a> which are queued for
  delivery.

  This storage mechanism is opaque, vendor-specific, and not exposed to the
  web, but it MUST provide the following methods which will be used in the
  algorithms this document defines:

  1.  Insert, update, and remove <a>clients</a>.
  2.  Enqueue and dequeue <a>reports</a> for delivery.
  3.  Retrieve a list of <a>client</a> objects for an <a spec="html">origin</a>.
  4.  Retrieve a list of queued <a>report</a> objects.
  5.  Clear the cache.

  <h3 id="concept-failover-load-balancing">Failover and load balancing</h3>

  The <a>endpoints</a> in an <a>endpoint group</a> that all have the same
  {{endpoint/priority}} form a <dfn export>failover class</dfn>.  Failover
  classes allow the developer to provide backup collectors (those with higher
  {{endpoint/priority}} values) that will only receive reports if **all** of the
  primary collectors (those with lower {{endpoint/priority}} values) fail.

  Developers can assign each <a>endpoint</a> in a <a>failover class</a> a
  {{endpoint/weight}}, which determines how report traffic is balanced across
  the <a>failover class</a>.

  The algorithm that implements these rules is described in
  [[#choose-endpoint]].

  Note: The {{endpoint/priority}} and {{endpoint/weight}} fields have the same
  semantics as the corresponding fields in a DNS <a>SRV record</a>.

  Note: Failover and load balancing is a feature that would be generally useful
  outside of Reporting.  Reporting delegates to the [[FETCH]] API to actually
  upload reports once an endpoint has been selected.  If, in the future, the
  Fetch API adds native support for failover and load balancing of requests, a
  future version of the Reporting API will be updated to use it instead of this
  bespoke mechanism.

<section>
  <h2 id="endpoint-delivery">Endpoint Delivery</h2>

  A server MAY define a set of reporting endpoints for an origin it controls
  via the <a>`Report-To`</a> HTTP response header field. This mechanism
  is defined in [[#header]], and its processing in [[#process-header]].

  <h3 id="header">The `Report-To` HTTP Response Header Field</h3>

  The <dfn export>`Report-To`</dfn> HTTP response header field instructs the
  user agent to store reporting endpoints for an origin. The header is
  represented by the following ABNF grammar [[!RFC5234]]:

  <pre class="abnf" link-type="grammar" dfn-type="grammar">
    Report-To = <a>json-field-value</a>
                ; See Section 2 of [[HTTP-JFV]], and Section 2 of [[RFC8259]]
  </pre>

  The header's value is interpreted as a JSON-formatted array of objects
  without the outer `[` and `]`, as described in Section 4 of [[HTTP-JFV]].

  Each object in the array defines an <a>endpoint group</a> to which reports may
  be delivered, and will be parsed as defined in [[#process-header]].

  The following subsections define the initial set of known members in each
  JSON object the header's value defines. Future versions of this document may
  define additional such members, and user agents MUST ignore unknown members
  when parsing the header.

  <h4 id="id-member">The `group` member</h4>

  The OPTIONAL <dfn for="ReportTo">`group`</dfn> member is a string that
  associates a {{endpoint group/name}} with the <a>endpoint group</a>. The
  member's value MUST be a string; any other type will result in a parse
  error. If no member named "`group`" is present in the object, the <a>endpoint
  group</a> will be given the {{endpoint group/name}} "`default`".

  <h4 id="include-subdomains-member">The `include_subdomains` member</h4>

  The OPTIONAL <dfn for="ReportTo">`include_subdomains`</dfn> member is a
  boolean that enables this <a>endpoint group</a> for all subdomains of the
  current <a spec="html">origin</a>'s {{URL/host}}.  If no member named
  "`include_subdomains`" is present in the object, or its value is not "`true`",
  the <a>endpoint group</a> will not be enabled for subdomains.

  <h4 id="max-age-member">The `max_age` member</h4>

  The REQUIRED <dfn for="ReportTo" export>`max_age`</dfn> member defines
  the <a>endpoint group</a>'s lifetime, as a non-negative integer number of
  seconds. The member's value MUST be a non-negative number; any other type will
  result in a parse error.

  A value of "`0`" will cause the <a>endpoint group</a> to be removed from the
  user agent's <a>reporting cache</a>.

  <h4 id="endpoints-member">The `endpoints` member</h4>

  The REQUIRED <dfn for="ReportTo" export>`endpoints`</dfn> member defines the
  list of
  <a>endpoints</a> that belong to this <a>endpoint group</a>. The member's value
  MUST be an array of JSON objects.

  The following subsections define the initial set of known members in each
  JSON object in the array. Future versions of this document may define
  additional such members, and user agents MUST ignore unknown members when
  parsing the elements of the array.

  <!--
  Note: If a group resolves to multiple <a>endpoints</a>, the user agent will
  deliver a particular <a>report</a> to <strong>at most one</strong>
  <a>endpoint</a> in that group on a best-effort basis.
  -->

  <h4 id="endpoints-url-member">The `endpoints.url` member</h4>

  The REQUIRED <dfn for="ReportTo">`url`</dfn> member is a string that defines
  the location of the <a>endpoint</a>. The member's value MUST be a string; any
  other type will result in a parse error.

  Moreover, the URL that the member's value represents MUST be <a>potentially
  trustworthy</a> [[!SECURE-CONTEXTS]]. Non-secure endpoints will be ignored.

  <h4 id="endpoints-priority-member">The `endpoints.priority` member</h4>

  The OPTIONAL <dfn for="ReportTo">`priority`</dfn> member is a number that
  defines which failover class the <a>endpoint</a> belongs to.  The member's
  value, if present, MUST be a non-negative integer; any other type will result
  in a parse error.

  <h4 id="endpoints-weight-member">The `endpoints.weight` member</h4>

  The OPTIONAL <dfn for="ReportTo">`weight`</dfn> member is a number that
  defines load balancing for the failover class that the <a>endpoint</a> belongs
  to.  The member's value, if present, MUST be a non-negative integer; any other
  type will result in a parse error.

  <h3 id="process-header" algorithm>
    Process reporting endpoints for |response| to |request|
  </h3>

  Given a <a>response</a> (|response|) and a <a>request</a> (|request|), this
  algorithm extracts a list of <a>endpoints</a> and <a>endpoint groups</a> for
  the request's <a spec="html">origin</a>, and updates the <a>reporting
  cache</a> accordingly.

  Note: This algorithm is called from around step 13 of <a>main fetch</a>
  [[FETCH]], and only updates the <a>reporting cache</a> if the |response|
  has been delivered securely.

  ISSUE: Fetch monkey patching. Talk to Anne.

  1.  Abort these steps if any of the following conditions are true:

      1.  |response|'s <a for="response" attribute>HTTPS state</a> is not
          "`modern`", and the <a lt="origin of a url">origin</a> of |response|'s
          <a for="response" attribute>url</a> is not <a>potentially
          trustworthy</a>.

      2.  |response|'s <a for="response" attribute>header list</a> does not
          contain a <a>header</a> whose <a for="header" attribute>name</a> is
          "<a>`Report-To`</a>".

  2.  Let |origin| be the <a lt="origin of a url">origin</a> of |response|'s
      <a for="response" attribute>url</a>.

  3.  Let |header| be the <a for="header" attribute>value</a> of the
      <a>header</a> in |response|'s <a for="response" attribute>header list</a>
      whose name is "<a>`Report-To`</a>".

  4.  Let |list| be the result of executing the algorithm defined in Section 4
      of [[HTTP-JFV]] on |header|. If that algorithm results in an error, abort
      these steps.

  5.  Let |groups| be an empty list.

  6.  For each |item| in |list|:

      1.  If |item| has no member named "<a for="ReportTo">`max_age`</a>", or
          that member's value is not a number, skip to the next |item|.

      2.  If |item| has no member named "<a>`endpoints`</a>", or that member's
          value is not an array, skip to the next |item|.

      3.  Let |name| be |item|'s "<a for="ReportTo">`group`</a>" member's value
          if present, and "`default`" otherwise.

      4.  If there is already an <a>endpoint group</a> in |groups| whose
          {{endpoint group/name}} is |name|, skip to the next |item|.

      5.  Let |endpoints| be an empty list.

      6.  For each |endpoint item| in the value of |item|'s "<a
          for="ReportTo">`endpoints`</a>" member:

          1.  If |endpoint item| has no member named "<a
              for="ReportTo">`url`</a>", or that member's value is not a
              string, skip to the next |endpoint item|.

          2.  If |endpoint item| has a member named "<a
              for="ReportTo">`priority`</a>", whose value is not a non-negative
              integer, skip to the next |endpoint item|.

          3.  If |endpoint item| has a member named "<a
              for="ReportTo">`weight`</a>", whose value is not a non-negative
              integer, skip to the next |endpoint item|.

          4.  Let |endpoint| be a new <a>endpoint</a> whose properties are set
              as follows:

              :   {{endpoint/url}}
              ::  The result of executing the <a>URL parser</a> on
                  |endpoint item|'s "<a for="ReportTo">`url`</a>" member's
                  value.
              :   {{endpoint/priority}}
              ::  The value of the |endpoint item|'s "<a
                  for="ReportTo">`priority`</a>" member, if present; `1`
                  otherwise.
              :   {{endpoint/weight}}
              ::  The value of the |endpoint item|'s "<a
                  for="ReportTo">`weight`</a>" member, if present; `1`
                  otherwise.
              :   {{endpoint/failures}}
              ::  0
              :   {{endpoint/retry_after}}
              ::  `null`

          5.  Add |endpoint| to |endpoints|.

      7.  Let |group| be a new <a>endpoint group</a> whose properties are
          set as follows:

          :   {{endpoint group/name}}
          ::  |name|
          :   {{endpoint group/subdomains}}
          ::  "`include`" if |item| has a member named
              "<a for="ReportTo">`include_subdomains`</a>" whose value is
              `true`, "`exclude`" otherwise.
          :   {{endpoint group/ttl}}
          ::  |item|'s "<a for="ReportTo">`max_age`</a>" member's value.
          :   {{endpoint group/creation}}
          ::  The current timestamp
          :   {{endpoint group/endpoints}}
          ::  |endpoints|

      8.  Add |group| to |groups|.

  7.  Let |client| be a new <a>client</a> whose properties are set as follows:

      :   {{client/origin}}
      ::  |origin|
      :   {{client/endpoint-groups}}
      ::  |groups|

  8.  If there is already an entry in the <a>reporting cache</a> for
      <a spec="html">origin</a>, replace it with |client|.  Otherwise, insert
      |client| into the <a>reporting cache</a> for <a spec="html">origin</a>.


<!-- Big Text: Reporting -->
<section>
  <h2 id="report-delivery">Report Delivery</h2>

  Over time, various features will queue up a list of <a>reports</a> in the
  user agent's <a>reporting cache</a>. The user agent will periodically grab
  the list of currently pending reports, and deliver them to the associated
  endpoints. This document does not define a schedule for the user agent to
  follow, and assumes that the user agent will have enough contextual
  information to deliver reports in a timely manner, balanced against impacting
  a user's experience.

  That said, a user agent SHOULD make a effort to deliver reports as soon as
  possible after queuing, as a report's data might be significantly more useful
  in the period directly after its generation than it would be a day or a week
  later.

  <h3 id="media-type">Media Type</h3>

  The media type used when POSTing reports to a specified endpoint is
  `application/reports+json`.

  <h3 id="queue-report" algorithm>
    Queue |data| as |type| for |endpoint group| on |settings|
  </h3>

  Given a serializable object (|data|), a string (|type|), another string
  (|endpoint group|), an <a>environment settings object</a> (|settings|), and an
  optional {{URL}} (|url|), the following algorithm will create a <a>report</a>,
  and add it to <a>reporting cache</a>'s queue for future delivery.

  1.  Let |report| be a new <a>report</a> object with its values initialized as
      follows:

      :   [=report/body=]
      ::  |data|
      :   [=report/user agent=]
      ::  The current value of <a><code>navigator.userAgent</code></a>
      :   [=report/group=]
      ::  |endpoint group|
      :   [=report/type=]
      ::  |type|
      :   [=report/timestamp=]
      ::  The current timestamp.
      :   [=report/attempts=]
      ::  0

  2.  If |url| was not provided by the caller, let |url| be |settings|'s
      <a>creation URL</a>.

  3.  Set |url|'s {{URL/username}} to the empty string, and its {{URL/password}}
      to `null`.

  4.  Set |report|'s [=report/url=] to the result of executing the <a>URL
      serializer</a> on |url| with the <em>exclude fragment flag</em> set.

  5.  Append |report| to the <a>reporting cache</a>.

  6.  Let |environment| be |settings|'s <a>realm execution context</a>'s
      <a spec=ecmascript>realm</a>'s <a spec=ecmascript lt=realm>ECMAScript
      global environment</a>.

  7.  Execute [[#notify-observers]] with |environment| and |report|.

  Note: <a>reporting observers</a> can only observe reports from the
  same <a>environment settings object</a>.

  Note: We strip the username, password, and fragment from the serialized URL
  in the report. See [[#capability-urls]].

  Note: The user agent MAY reject reports for any reason. This API does not
  guarantee delivery of arbitrary amounts of data, for instance.

  Note: Non user agent clients (with no JavaScript engine) should not interact
  with <a>reporting observers</a>, and thus should return in step 6.

  <h3 id="choose-endpoint">
    Choose an |endpoint| from a |group|
  </h3>

  Note: This algorithm is the same as the <a for="SRV">target selection
    algorithm</a> used for DNS <a>SRV records</a>.

  Given an <a>endpoint group</a> (|group|), this algorithm chooses an arbitrary
  eligible <a>endpoint</a> from the group, if there is one, taking into account
  the {{endpoint/priority}} and {{endpoint/weight}} of the <a>endpoints</a>.

  1.  If |group| is <a for="endpoint group">expired</a>, return `null`.

      Note: In this case, the user agent MAY remove |group| from its
      <a>client</a>, or it may wait and collect garbage <i lang="fr">en
      masse</i> at some point in the future as described in [[#gc]].

  2.  Let |endpoints| be a copy of |group|'s {{endpoint group/endpoints}} list.

  3.  Remove every |endpoint| from |endpoints| that is
      <a for="endpoint">pending</a>.

  4.  If |endpoints| is empty, return `null`.

  5.  Let |priority| be the minimum {{endpoint/priority}} value of each
      |endpoint| in |endpoints|.

  6.  Remove every |endpoint| from |endpoints| whose {{endpoint/priority}} value
      is not equal to |priority|.

  7.  If |endpoints| is empty, return `null`.

  8.  Let |total weight| be the sum of the {{endpoint/weight}} value of each
      |endpoint| in |endpoints|.

  9.  Let |weight| be a random number &ge; 0 and &le; |total weight|.

  10. For each |endpoint| in |endpoints|:

      1.  If |weight| is less than or equal to |endpoint|'s {{endpoint/weight}},
          return |endpoint|.

      2.  Subtract |endpoint|'s {{endpoint/weight}} from |weight|.

  11. It should not be possible to fall through to here, since the random number
      chosen earlier will be less than or equal to |total weight|.

  <h3 id="send-reports" algorithm>
    Send reports
  </h3>

  A user agent sends reports by executing the following steps:

  1.  Let |reports| be a copy of the list of queued <a>report</a> objects in
      <a>reporting cache</a>.

  2.  Let |endpoint map| be an empty map of <a>endpoint</a> objects to lists of
      <a>report</a> objects.

  3.  For each |report| in |reports|:

      1.  Let |origin| be the <a>origin</a> of |report|'s [=report/url=].

      2.  Let |client| be the entry in the <a>reporting cache</a> for
          |origin|.

      3.  If there exists an <a>endpoint group</a> (|group|) in |client|'s
          {{client/endpoint-groups}} list whose {{endpoint group/name}} is
          |report|'s [=report/group=]:

          1.  Let |endpoint| be the result of executing [[#choose-endpoint]] on
              |group|.

          2.  If |endpoint| is a not `null`:

              1.  Append |report| to |endpoint map|'s list of reports for
                  |endpoint|.

              2.  Skip to the next |report|.

      4.  For each |parent origin| that is a <a>superdomain match</a>
          for |origin| [[!RFC6797]]:

          1.  Let |client| be the entry in the <a>reporting cache</a> for
              |parent origin|.

          2.  If there exists an <a>endpoint group</a> (|group|) in |client|'s
              {{client/endpoint-groups}} list whose {{endpoint group/name}} is
              |report|'s [=report/group=] <b>and</b> whose {{endpoint
              group/subdomains}} flag is "`include`":

              1.  Let |endpoint| be the result of executing [[#choose-endpoint]]
                  on |group|.

              2.  If |endpoint| is an <a>endpoint</a>:

                  1.  Append |report| to |endpoint map|'s list of reports for
                      |endpoint|.

                  2.  Skip to the next |report|.

      5.  If we reach this step, the |report| did not match any <a>endpoint</a>
          and the user agent MAY remove |report| from the <a>reporting cache</a>
          directly. Depending on load, the user agent MAY instead wait for
          [[#gc]] at some point in the future.

  4.  For each (|endpoint|, |reports|) pair in |endpoint map|:

      1.  Let |origin map| be an empty map of <a spec="html">origins</a> to
          lists of <a>report</a> objects.

      2.  For each |report| in |reports|:

          1.  Let |origin| be the <a>origin</a> of |report|'s [=report/url=].

          2.  Append |report| to |origin map|'s list of reports for |origin|.

      3.  For each (|origin|, |per-origin reports|) pair in |origin map|,
          execute the following steps asynchronously:

          1.  Let |result| be the result of executing [[#try-delivery]] on
              |endpoint|, |origin|, and |per-origin reports|.

          2.  If |result| is "`Success`":

              1.  Set |endpoint|'s {{endpoint/failures}} to 0, and its
                  {{endpoint/retry_after}} to `null`.

              2.  Remove each <a>report</a> in |reports| from the <a>reporting
                  cache</a>.

              Otherwise, if |result| is "`Remove Endpoint`":

              1.  Remove |endpoint| from the reporting cache.

                  Note: |reports| remain in the reporting cache for potential
                  delivery to other endpoints.

              Otherwise (if |result| is "`Failure`"):

              1.  Increment |endpoint|'s {{endpoint/failures}}.

              2.  Set |endpoint|'s {{endpoint/retry_after}} to a point in the
                  future which the user agent chooses.

                  Note: We don't specify a particular algorithm here, but user
                  agents are encouraged to employ some sort of exponential
                  backoff algorithm which increases the retry period with the
                  number of failures, with the addition of some random jitter to
                  ensure that temporary failures don't lead to a crush of
                  reports all being retried on the same schedule.

                  ISSUE: Add in a reasonable reference describing a good
                  algorithm.  Wikipedia, if nothing else.

  Note: User agents MAY decide to attempt delivery for only a subset of the
  collected reports or endpoints (because, for example, sending all the reports
  at once would consume an unreasonable amount of bandwidth, etc). As reports
  are only removed from the cache when they're successfully delivered, skipped
  reports will simply be delivered later.

  <h3 id="try-delivery" algorithm>
    Attempt to deliver |reports| to |endpoint|
  </h3>

  Given an <a>endpoint</a> (|endpoint|), an <a spec="html">origin</a>
  (|origin|), and a list of <a>reports</a> (|reports|), this algorithm will
  construct a <a>request</a>, and attempt to deliver it to |endpoint|. It
  returns "`Success`" if that delivery succeeds, "`Remove Endpoint`" if the
  endpoint explicitly removes itself as a reporting endpoint by sending a 410
  response, and "`Failure`" otherwise.

  1.  Let |collection| be a new ECMAScript `Array` object [[!ECMA-262]].

  2.  For each |report| in |reports|:

      1.  Let |data| be a new ECMAScript `Object` with the following properties
          [[!ECMA-262]]:

          :   `age`
          ::  The number of milliseconds between |report|'s [=report/timestamp=]
              and the current time.
          :   `type`
          ::  |report|'s [=report/type=]
          :   `url`
          ::  |report|'s [=report/url=]
          :   `user_agent`
          ::  |report|'s [=report/user agent=]
          :   `body`
          ::  |report|'s [=report/body=]

          Note: Client clocks are unreliable and subject to skew. We therefore
          deliver an `age` attribute rather than an absolute timestamp. See
          also [[#fingerprinting-clock-skew]]

      2.  Increment |report|'s [=report/attempts=].

      3.  Append |data| to |collection|.

  3.  Let |request| be a new <a>request</a> with the following properties
      [[FETCH]]:

      :   `url`
      ::  |endpoint|'s {{endpoint/url}}
      :   `origin`
      ::  |origin|
      :   `header list`
      ::  A new <a>header list</a> containing a <a>header</a> named
          "`Content-Type`" whose value is "`application/reports+json`"
      :   `client`
      ::  `null`
      :   `window`
      ::  "`no-window`"
      :   `service-worker mode`
      ::  "`none`"
      :   `initiator`
      ::  ""
      :   `destination`
      ::  "`report`"
      :   `mode`
      ::  "`cors`"
      :   `unsafe-request` flag
      ::  set
      :   `credentials`
      ::  "`include`"
      :   `body`
      ::  A [=/body=] whose [=body/source=] is the [=byte sequence=] resulting
          from executing [=serialize JSON to bytes=] on |collection|.

  4.  <a>Queue a task</a> to <a>fetch</a> |request|.

  5.  <a>Wait for a response</a> (|response|).

  6.  If |response|'s `status` is an <a>OK status</a> (200-299), return
      "`Success`".

  7.  If |response|'s `status` is `410 Gone` [[!RFC7231]], return "`Remove
      Endpoint`".

  8.  Return "`Failure`".

  <h2 id="observers">Reporting Observers</h2>

  A <dfn>reporting observer</dfn> observes some types of <a>reports</a> from
  JavaScript, and is represented in JavaScript by the {{ReportingObserver}}
  object.

  Each <a spec=ecmascript lt=realm>ECMAScript global environment</a> has
  a <dfn>registered reporting observer list</dfn>, which is an <a>ordered
  set</a> of <a>reporting observers</a>.

  Any <a>reporting observer</a> that is in a <a>registered reporting observer
  list</a> is considered <dfn>registered</dfn>.

  Each <a spec=ecmascript lt=realm>ECMAScript global environment</a> has
  a <dfn>report buffer</dfn>, which is a <a spec=infra>list</a>
  of <a>reports</a> that have been generated in that <a spec=ecmascript
  lt=realm>ECMAScript global environment</a>. This list is initially empty, and
  the reports are stored in the same order in which they are generated.

  Note: The purpose of the <a>report buffer</a> is to allow <a>reporting
  observers</a> to observe reports that were generated earlier than that
  observer could be created (via the {{buffered}} option). For example, some
  reports might be generated during an earlier stage of page loading than when
  an observer could first be created, or before a JavaScript library is loaded
  that wishes to observe these reports.

  Note: </a>Reporting observers</a> are only relevant for user agents with
  JavaScript engines.

  returns [=report/type=], <dfn attribute for="Report">url</dfn> returns
  [=report/url=], and <dfn attribute for="Report">body</dfn> returns
  [=report/body=].

  Each {{ReportingObserver}} object has these associated concepts:
    - A <dfn for=ReportingObserver>callback</dfn> function set on creation.
    - A {{ReportingObserverOptions}} dictionary called
      <dfn for=ReportingObserver>options</dfn>.
    - A list of {{Report}} objects called the <dfn for=ReportingObserver>report
      queue</dfn>, which is initially empty.

  A {{ReportList}} represents a sequence of {{Report}}s, providing developers
  with all the convenience methods found on JavaScript arrays.

  The <dfn constructor for=ReportingObserver><code>
  ReportingObserver(|callback|, |options|)</code></dfn> constructor, when
  invoked, must run these steps:

  1. Create a new {{ReportingObserver}} object |observer|.

  2. Set |observer|'s <a>callback</a> to |callback|.

  3. Set |observer|'s <a>options</a> to |options|.

  4. Return |observer|.

  The <dfn method for=ReportingObserver><code>observe()</code></dfn>
  method, when invoked, must run these steps:

  1. Let |environment| be the <a spec=ecmascript lt=realm>ECMAScript global
     environment</a> associated with the <a>context object</a>.

  2. Append the <a>context object</a> to the <a>registered reporting observer

  3. If the <a>context object</a>'s {{buffered}} <a>option</a> is false, return.

  The <dfn method for=ReportingObserver><code>takeRecords()</code></dfn> method,

  1. Let |reports| be a copy of the <a>context object</a>'s <a>report queue</a>.

  2. Empty the <a>context object</a>'s <a>report queue</a>.

  3. Return |reports|.

  <h3 id="notify-observers" algorithm>
    Notify reporting observers on |environment| with |report|
  </h3>

  This algorithm makes |report|'s contents available to any <a>registered</a>
  <a>reporting observers</a> on the provided <a spec=ecmascript
  lt=realm>ECMAScript global environment</a> |environment|.

  1. For each {{ReportingObserver}} |observer| <a>registered</a> with
     |environment|, execute [[#add-report]] on |report| and |observer|.

  2. Append |report| to the <a>report buffer</a> associated with |environment|.

  3. Let |type| be |report|'s <a>type</a>.

  4. If the <a>report buffer</a> now contains more than 100 reports

  Given a <a>report</a> |report| and a {{ReportingObserver}} |observer|, this

  |report|'s <a>type</a> is observable by |observer|.

  1. If |report|'s [=report/type=] is not <a>visible to
    <code>ReportingObserver</code>s</a>, return.

  2. If |observer|'s <a>options</a> has a non-empty
     {{ReportingObserverOptions/types}} member which does not contain |report|'s

  3. Append |r| to |observer|'s <a>report queue</a>.

  4. If the size of |observer|'s <a>report queue</a> is 1, <a>Queue a task</a>

  1. For each {{ReportingObserver}} |observer| in |notify list|:

  <h2 id="report-types">Report Types</h2>

  <h3 id="deprecation-report">Deprecation</h3>

  <dfn>Deprecation reports</dfn> indicate that a browser API or feature has been
  used which is expected to stop working in a future update to the browser.

  <a>Deprecation reports</a> have the <a>report type</a> "deprecation".

  <a>Deprecation reports</a> are <a>visible to
  <code>ReportingObserver</code>s</a>.

  <pre class="idl">
    [Exposed=(Window,Worker)]
    interface DeprecationReportBody : ReportBody {
      readonly attribute DOMString id;
      readonly attribute Date? anticipatedRemoval;
      readonly attribute DOMString message;
      readonly attribute DOMString? sourceFile;
      readonly attribute unsigned long? lineNumber;
      readonly attribute unsigned long? columnNumber;
    };
  </pre>

  A <a>deprecation report</a>'s [=report/body=], represented in JavaScript by
  {{DeprecationReportBody}}, contains the following fields:

    - <dfn for="DeprecationReportBody">id</dfn>: an implementation-defined
      string identifying the feature or API that will be removed. This string
      can be used for grouping and counting related reports.

    - <dfn for="DeprecationReportBody">anticipatedRemoval</dfn>: A
      JavaScript <a>Date object</a> (rendered as an ISO 8601 string) indicating
      roughly when the browser version without the specified API will be
      generally available (excluding "beta" or other pre-release channels). This
      value should be used to sort or prioritize warnings. If unknown, this
      field should be null, and the deprecation should be considered low
      priority (removal may not actually occur).

    - <dfn for="DeprecationReportBody">message</dfn>: A human-readable string
      with details typically matching what would be displayed on the developer
      console. The message is not guaranteed to be unique for a given
      [=DeprecationReportBody/id=] (eg. it may contain additional context on how
      the API was used).

    - <dfn for="DeprecationReportBody">sourceFile</dfn>: If known, the file
      which first used the indicated API, or null otherwise.

    - <dfn for="DeprecationReportBody">lineNumber</dfn>: If known, the line
      number in [=DeprecationReportBody/sourceFile=] where the indicated API
      was first used, or null otherwise.

    - <dfn for="DeprecationReportBody">columnNumber</dfn>: If known, the column
      number in [=DeprecationReportBody/sourceFile=] where the indicated API
      was first used, or null otherwise.

  <div class="example">

  Note: Deprecation reports are always delivered to the <a>endpoint group</a>
  named <code>default</code>; there is currently no way to override this.  If
  you want to receive other kinds of reports, but not deprecation reports, make
  sure to use a different name for the endpoint group that you choose for those
  reports.

  <h3 id="intervention-report">Intervention</h3>

  <dfn>Intervention reports</dfn> indicate that a user agent has decided not to
  honor a request made by the application (e.g. for security, performance or
  user annoyance reasons). Note that the report properties are the same as those
  for <a>deprecation reports</a>, except for the absence of
  [=DeprecationReportBody/anticipatedRemoval=].

  <a>Intervention reports</a> have the <a>report type</a> "intervention".

  <a>Intervention reports</a> are <a>visible to
  <code>ReportingObserver</code>s</a>.

  <pre class="idl">
    [Exposed=(Window,Worker)]
    interface InterventionReportBody : ReportBody {
      readonly attribute DOMString id;

      readonly attribute DOMString? sourceFile;
      readonly attribute unsigned long? lineNumber;
      readonly attribute unsigned long? columnNumber;
    };
  </pre>

  An <a>intervention report</a>'s [=report/body=], represented in JavaScript by
  {{InterventionReportBody}}, contains the following fields:

    - <dfn for="InterventionReportBody">id</dfn>: an implementation-defined
      string identifying the specific intervention that occurred. This string
      can be used for grouping and counting related reports.

    - <dfn for="InterventionReportBody">message</dfn>: A human-readable string
      with details typically matching what would be displayed on the developer
      console. The message is not guaranteed to be unique for a given
      [=InterventionReportBody/id=] (e.g. it may contain additional context on
      what led to the intervention).

    - <dfn for="InterventionReportBody">sourceFile</dfn>: If known, the file
      which first used the indicated API, or null otherwise.

    - <dfn for="InterventionReportBody">lineNumber</dfn>: If known, the line
      number in [=InterventionReportBody/sourceFile=] of the offending behavior
      (which prompted the intervention), or null otherwise.

    - <dfn for="InterventionReportBody">columnNumber</dfn>: If known, the
      column number in [=InterventionReportBody/sourceFile=] of the offending
      behavior (which prompted the intervention), or null otherwise.

  sure to use a different name for the endpoint group that you choose for those
  reports.

  <h3 id="crash-report">Crash</h3>

  <dfn>Crash reports</dfn> indicate that the user was unable to continue using
  the page because the browser (or one of its processes necessary for the page)
  crashed. For security reasons, no details of the crash are communicated except
  for a unique identifier (which can be interpreted by the browser vendor), and
  optionally the reason for the crash (such as "oom").

  <a>Crash reports</a> have the <a>report type</a> "crash".

  <pre class="idl">
    [Exposed=(Window,Worker)]
    interface CrashReportBody : ReportBody {
      readonly attribute DOMString? reason;
    };

  An <a>crash report</a>'s [=report/body=], represented in JavaScript by
  {{CrashReportBody}}, contains the following field:

    - <dfn for="CrashReportBody">reason</dfn>: A more specific classification of
      the type of crash that occured, if known, or omitted otherwise. The
      valid <a>reason</a> strings are shown below.

  <h2 id="implementation">Implementation Considerations</h2>

  <h3 id="delivery">Delivery</h3>

  The user agent SHOULD attempt to deliver reports as soon as possible to
  provide feedback to developers as quickly as possible. However, when this
  desire is balanced against the impact on the user, the user wins. With that
  in mind, the user agent MAY delay delivery of reports based on its knowledge
  of the user's activities and context.

  For instance, the user agent SHOULD prioritize the transmission of reporting
  data lower than other network traffic. The user's explicit activities on a
  website should preempt reporting traffic.

  The user agent MAY choose to withhold report delivery entirely until the user
  is on a fast, cheap network in order to prevent unnecessary data cost.

  The user agent MAY choose to prioritize reports from particular origins over
  others (perhaps those that the user visits most often?)

  <h3 id="gc">Garbage Collection</h3>

  Periodically, the user agent SHOULD walk through the cached <a>reports</a>
  and <a>endpoints</a>, and discard those that are no longer relevant. These
  include:

  *   <a>endpoint groups</a> which are <a for="endpoint group">expired</a>
  *   <a>endpoint groups</a> which have not been used in some arbitrary period
      of time (perhaps a ~week?)
  *   <a>endpoints</a> whose {{endpoint/failures}} exceed
      some user-agent-defined threshold (~5 seems reasonable)
  *   <a>reports</a> whose [=report/attempts=] exceed
      some user-agent-defined threshold (~5 seems reasonable)
  *   <a>reports</a> which have not been delivered in some arbitrary period of
      time (perhaps ~2 days?)

  For any <a>reports</a> that are discarded, these <a>reports</a> should also be
  removed from the <a>report buffer</a> of any <a>reporting observer</a>.

  <h2 id="automation">Automation</h2>

  For the purposes of user-agent automation and application testing, this
  document defines a number of <a>extension commands</a> for the [[WebDriver]]
  specification.

  <h3 id="generate-test-report-command">Generate Test Report</h3>

  The <dfn>Generate Test Report</dfn> <a>extension command</a> simulates the
  generation of a <a>report</a> for the purposes of testing. This report will be
  observed by any <a>registered</a> <a>reporting observers</a>.

  The <a>extension command</a> is defined as follows:

  <pre class='idl'>
    dictionary GenerateTestReportParameters {
      required DOMString message;
      DOMString group = "default";
    };
  </pre>

  <table style="border-spacing: 20px 0px;">
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <th>HTTP Method</th>
        <th><a lt="extension command uri template">URI Template</a></th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>`POST`</td>
        <td>`/session/{session id}/reporting/generate_test_report`</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  The <a>remote end steps</a> are:

  1. If |parameters| is not a JSON <a>Object</a>, return a <a>WebDriver
     error</a> with <a>WebDriver error code</a> <a>invalid argument</a>.

  2. Let |message| be the result of <a>trying</a> to get |parameters|'s
     {{GenerateTestReportParameters/message}} property.

  3. If |message| is not present, return a <a>WebDriver error</a>
     with <a>WebDriver error code</a> <a>invalid argument</a>.

  4. If the <a>current browsing context</a> is no longer open, return a
     <a>WebDriver error</a> with <a>WebDriver error code</a> <a>no such
     window</a>.

  5. <a>Handle any user prompts</a> and return its value if it is a <a>WebDriver
     error</a>.

  6. Let |group| be |parameters|'s {{GenerateTestReportParameters/group}}
     property.

  7. Let |body| be a new object that can be serialized into a <a>JSON text</a>,
     containing a single string field, |body_message|.

  8. Set |body_message| to |message|.

  9. Let |settings| be the <a>environment settings object</a> of the
     <a>current browsing context</a>'s <a>active document</a>.

  10. Execute [[#queue-report]] with |body|, "test", |group|, and |settings|.

  11. Return <a>success</a> with data null.

  <h2 id="security">Security Considerations</h2>

  <h3 id="capability-urls">Capability URLs</h3>

  Some URLs are valuable in and of themselves. To mitigate the possibility
  that such URLs will be leaked via this reporting mechanism, we strip out
  credential information and fragment data from the URL we store as a
  <a>report</a>'s originator. It is still possible, however, for a feature
  to unintentionally leak such data via a report's [=report/body=]. Implementers
  SHOULD ensure that URLs contained in a report's body are similarly stripped.
</section>

<section>
  <h2 id="privacy">Privacy Considerations</h2>

  <h3 id="network-leakage">Network Leakage</h3>

  Because this reporting mechanism is out-of-band, and doesn't rely on a page
  being open, it's entirely possible for a report generated while a user is on
  one network to be sent while the user is on another network, even if they
  don't explicitly open the page from which the report was sent.

  ISSUE(w3c/BackgroundSync#107): Consider mitigations. For example, we could
  drop reports if we change from one network to another.

  <h3 id="fingerprinting-clock-skew">Clock Skew</h3>

  Each report is delivered along with an `age` property, rather than the
  timestamp at which it was generated. We do this because each user's local
  clock will be skewed from the clock on the server by an arbitrary amount.
  The difference between the time the report was generated and the time it
  was sent will be stable, regardless of clock skew, and we can avoid the
  fingerprinting risk of exposing the clock skew via this API.

  <h3 id="correlation">Cross-origin correlation</h3>

  If multiple origins all use the same reporting endpoint, that endpoint may
  learn that a particular user has interacted with a certain set of websites,
  as it will receive origin-tagged reports from each. This doesn't seem worse
  than the status quo ability to track the same information from cooperative
  origins, and doesn't grant any new tracking ability above and beyond what's
  possible with `<img>` today.

  <h3 id="subdomains">Subdomains</h3>

  This specification allows any resource on a host to declare a set of reporting
  endpoints for that host and each of its subdomains. This doesn't have privacy
  implications in and of itself (beyond those noted in [[#clear-cache]]), as the
  reporting endpoints themselves don't take any real action, as features will
  need to opt-into using these reporting endpoints explicitly. Those features
  certainly will have privacy implications, and should carefully consider
  whether they should be enabled across origin boundaries.

  <h3 id="clear-cache">Clearing the reporting cache</h3>

  A user agent's <a>reporting cache</a> contains data about a user's activity
  on the web, and user agents ought to handle this data carefully. In
  particular, if a user agent gives users the ability to clear their site data,
  browsing history, browsing cache, or similar, the user agent MUST also clear
  the <a>reporting cache</a>. Note that this includes both the pending reports
  themselves, as well as the endpoints to which they would be sent. Both MUST
  be cleared.

  <h3 id="disable">Disabling Reporting</h3>

  Reporting is, to some extent, a question of commons. In the aggregate, it
  seems useful for everyone for reports to be delivered. There is direct benefit
  to developers, as they can fix bugs, which means there's indirect benefit to
  users, as the sites they enjoy will be more stable and enjoyable. As a
  concrete example, Content Security Policy grants something like herd immunity
  to cross-site scripting attacks by alerting developers about potential holes
  in their sites' defenses. Fixing those bugs helps every user, even those whose
  user agents don't support Content Security Policy.

  The calculus, of course, depends on the nature of data that's being delivered,
  and the relative maliciousness of the reporting endpoints, but that's the
  value proposition in broad strokes.

  That said, it can't be the case that this general benefit be allowed to take
  priority over the ability of a user to individually opt-out of such a system.
  Sending reports costs bandwidth, and potentially could reveal some small
  amount of additional information above and beyond what a website can obtain
  in-band ([[NETWORK-ERROR-LOGGING]], for instance). User agents MUST allow
  users to disable reporting with some reasonable amount of granularity in order
  to maintain the priority of constituencies espoused in
  [[HTML-DESIGN-PRINCIPLES]].
