Abstract:
  This document defines a generic reporting framework which allows web
  developers to associate a set of named reporting endpoints with an origin.
  Various platform features (such as Network Error Logging) can use these
  endpoints to deliver feature-specific reports in a consistent manner.

  <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

  This document provides three pieces of infrastructure for generic reporting,
  which may be used or extended by other specifications:

  1. A generic framework for defining report types and reporting endpoints, and
     a document format for sending reports to endpoints over HTTP.

  2. A specific mechanism for configuring reporting endpoints in a document, and
     for delivering reports whose lifetime is tied to that document.

  3. A JavaScript interface for observing reports generated within a document.

  Other specifications may extend or make use of these pieces, for instance by
  defining concrete report types, or alternative configuration or delivery
  mechanisms for non-document-based reports.

  <h3 id="guarantees">Guarantees</h3>

  This specification aims to provide a best-effort report delivery system that
  executes out-of-band with website activity. The user agent will be able to do
  a better job prioritizing and scheduling delivery of reports, as it has an
  overview of cross-origin activity that individual websites do not, and can
  deliver reports based on error conditions that would prevent a website from
  loading in the first place.

  The delivery is not, however, guaranteed in any way, and reporting is not
  intended to be used as a reliable communications channel. Network conditions
  may prevent reports from reaching their destination at all, and user agents
  are permitted to reject and not deliver a report for any reason.

  <h3 id="examples">Examples</h3>

  <div class="example">
    MegaCorp Inc. wants to collect Content Security Policy and Key Pinning
    violation reports. It can do so by delivering the following header to
    define a set of reporting endpoints named "`endpoint-1`":

    <pre>
      <a>Reporting-Endpoints</a>: endpoint-1="https://example.com/reports"
    </pre>

    And the following headers, which direct CSP and HPKP reports to that
    endpoint:

    <pre>
      <a>Content-Security-Policy</a>: ...; <a lt="reports directive">report-to</a> endpoint-1
      <a>Public-Key-Pins</a>: ...; report-to=endpoint-1
    </pre>
  </div>

  <div class="example">
    After processing reports for a little while, MegaCorp Inc. decides to split
    the processing of these two types of reports out into two distinct endpoints
    in order to make the processing scripts simpler. It can do so by delivering
    the following header to define two reporting endpoints:

    <pre>
      <a>Reporting-Endpoints</a>: csp-endpoint="https://example.com/csp-reports",
                           hpkp-endpoint="https://example.com/hpkp-reports"
    </pre>

    And the following headers, which direct CSP and HPKP reports to those named
    endpoints:

    <pre>
      <a>Content-Security-Policy</a>: ...; <a lt="reports directive">report-to</a> csp-endpoint
      <a>Public-Key-Pins</a>: ...; report-to=hpkp-endpoint
    </pre>
  </div>

<section>
  <h2 id="generic-reporting">Generic Reporting Framework</h2>

  <p class="informative">
  This section defines the generic concepts of reports and endpoints, and how
  reports are serialized into the <a
  href="#media-type">`application/reports+json`</a> format.</p>

  <h3 id="concept">Concepts</h3>

  <h4 id="concept-endpoints">Endpoints</h4>

  An <dfn export>endpoint</dfn> is location to which <a>reports</a> for a
  particular <a spec="html">origin</a> may be sent.

  Each <a>endpoint</a> has a
  <dfn for="endpoint" export attribute>name</dfn>, which is an ASCII string.

  Each <a>endpoint</a> has a <dfn for="endpoint" export attribute>url</dfn>,
  which is a {{URL}}.

  Each <a>endpoint</a> has a
  <dfn for="endpoint" export attribute>failures</dfn>, which is a non-negative
  integer representing the number of consecutive times this endpoint has failed
  to respond to a request.

  <h4 id="concept-report-type">Report Type</h4>

  A <dfn export>report type</dfn> is a non-empty string that specifies the set
  of data that is contained in the [=report/body=] of a <a>report</a>.

  When a <a>report type</a> is defined (in this spec or others), it can be
  specified to be <dfn>visible to <code>ReportingObserver</code>s</dfn>, meaning
  that <a>reports</a> of that type can be observed by a <a>reporting
  observer</a>. By default, <a>report types</a> are not <a>visible to
  <code>ReportingObserver</code>s</a>.

  <h4 id="concept-reports">Reports</h4>

  A <dfn export>report</dfn> is a collection of arbitrary data which the user
  agent is expected to deliver to a specified endpoint.

  Each <a>report</a> has a <dfn for="report" export>body</dfn>, which is either
  `null` or an object which can be serialized into a <a>JSON text</a>. The
  fields contained in a <a>report</a>'s [=report/body=] are determined by
  the <a>report</a>'s [=report/type=].

  Each <a>report</a> has a <dfn for="report" export>url</dfn>, which
  is typically the address of the `Document` or `Worker` from which the report
  was generated.

  Note: We strip the username, password, and fragment from this serialized URL.
  See [[#capability-urls]].

  Each <a>report</a> has a <dfn for="report" export>user agent</dfn>, which is
  the value of the <code>User-Agent</code> <a>header</a> of the <a>request</a>
  from which the report was generated.

  Note: The <a for="report">user agent</a> of a <a>report</a> represents the
  <code>User-Agent</code> sent by the browser for the page which generated the
  <a>report</a>.  This is potentially distinct from the <code>User-Agent</code>
  sent in the HTTP headers when uploading the report to a collector — for
  instance, where the browser has chosen to use a non-default
  <code>User-Agent</code> string such as the "request desktop site" feature.

  Each <a>report</a> has a <dfn for="report" export>destination</dfn>,
  which is a string representing the {{endpoint/name}} of the <a>document</a>'s
  <a>endpoint</a> that the report will be sent to.

  Each <a>report</a> has a <dfn for="report" id="report-reporttype"
  export>type</dfn>, which is a <a>report type</a>.

  Each <a>report</a> has a <dfn for="report" export>timestamp</dfn>,
  which records the time at which the report was generated, in milliseconds
  since the unix epoch.

  Each <a>report</a> has an <dfn for="report" export>attempts</dfn>
  counter, which is a non-negative integer representing the number of times the
  user agent attempted to deliver the report.

  <h3 id="media-type">Media Type</h3>

  The media type used when POSTing reports to a specified endpoint is
  `application/reports+json`.

  <h3 id="queue-report" algorithm>
    Queue |data| as |type| for |destination|
  </h3>

  Given a serializable object (|data|), a string (|type|), another string
  (|destination|), an optional <a>environment settings object</a>
  (|settings|), and an optional {{URL}} (|url|), the following algorithm will
  create a <a>report</a>, which can be queued for future delivery.

  1.  Let |report| be a new <a>report</a> object with its values initialized as
      follows:

      :   [=report/body=]
      ::  |data|
      :   [=report/user agent=]
      ::  The current value of <a><code>navigator.userAgent</code></a>
      :   [=report/destination=]
      ::  |destination|
      :   [=report/type=]
      ::  |type|
      :   [=report/timestamp=]
      ::  The current timestamp.
      :   [=report/attempts=]
      ::  0

  2.  If |url| was not provided by the caller, let |url| be |settings|'s
      <a>creation URL</a>.

  3.  Set |url|'s {{URL/username}} to the empty string, and its {{URL/password}}
      to `null`.

  4.  Set |report|'s [=report/url=] to the result of executing the <a>URL
      serializer</a> on |url| with the <em>exclude fragment flag</em> set.

  5.  If |settings| is given, then

      1.  Let |environment| be |settings|'s <a>realm execution context</a>'s
          <a spec=ecmascript>realm</a>'s <a spec=ecmascript lt=realm>ECMAScript
          global environment</a>.

      2.  Execute [[#notify-observers]] with |environment| and |report|.

  6.  Return |report|.

  Note: <a>reporting observers</a> can only observe reports from the
  same <a>environment settings object</a>.

  Note: We strip the username, password, and fragment from the serialized URL
  in the report. See [[#capability-urls]].

  Note: The user agent MAY reject reports for any reason. This API does not
  guarantee delivery of arbitrary amounts of data, for instance.

  Note: Non user agent clients (with no JavaScript engine) should not interact
  with <a>reporting observers</a>, and thus should return in step 6.


  <h3 id="serialize-reports" algorithm>Serialize Reports</h3>

  To <dfn>serialize a list of |reports| to JSON</dfn>,

  1.  Let |collection| be a new ECMAScript `Array` object [[!ECMA-262]].

  2.  For each |report| in |reports|:

      1.  Let |data| be a new ECMAScript `Object` with the following properties
          [[!ECMA-262]]:

          :   `age`
          ::  The number of milliseconds between |report|'s [=report/timestamp=]
              and the current time.
          :   `type`
          ::  |report|'s [=report/type=]
          :   `url`
          ::  |report|'s [=report/url=]
          :   `user_agent`
          ::  |report|'s [=report/user agent=]
          :   `body`
          ::  |report|'s [=report/body=]

          Note: Client clocks are unreliable and subject to skew. We therefore
          deliver an `age` attribute rather than an absolute timestamp. See
          also [[#fingerprinting-clock-skew]]

      2.  Increment |report|'s [=report/attempts=].

      3.  Append |data| to |collection|.

  3. Return the [=byte sequence=] resulting from executing [=serialize JSON to
     bytes=] on |collection|.

<section>
  <h2 id="document-reporting">Document Centered Reporting</h2>

  This section defines the mechanism for configuring reporting endpoints for
  reports generated by actions in a document. Such reports have a lifetime which
  is tied to the document where they generated.

  <h3 id="document-configuration">Document configuration</h3>

  Each <a>document</a> has an <dfn for="document" export
  attribute>endpoints</dfn> list, which is a list of <a>endpoints</a>, each of
  which MUST have a distinct {{endpoint/name}}.  (The algorithm in
  [[#process-header]] guarantees this by keeping the first entry in a
  `Reporting-Endpoints` header with a particular name.)

  A server MAY define a set of reporting endpoints for a resource it returns,
  via the <a>`Reporting-Endpoints`</a> HTTP response header field. This
  mechanism is defined in [[#header]], and its processing in
  [[#process-header]].

  Each <a>document</a> has an <dfn for="document" export attribute>reports</dfn>
  list, which is a list of <a>reports</a>.

  <h3 id="header">The `Reporting-Endpoints` HTTP Response Header Field</h3>

  The value of the <dfn export>`Reporting-Endpoints`</dfn> HTTP response header
  field is used to construct the reporting configuration for a resource.

  <a>`Reporting-Endpoints`</a> is a Dictionary Structured Header
  [[STRUCTURED-HEADERS]]. Each entry in the dictionary defines an
  <a>endpoint</a> to which reports may be delivered. The entry value MUST be a
  string.

  Each <a>endpoint</a> is defined by a String Item, which is interpreted as a
  URI-reference. If its value is not a valid URI-reference, that <a>endpoint</a>
  member MUST be ignored.

  Moreover, the URL that the member's value represents MUST be <a>potentially
  trustworthy</a> [[!SECURE-CONTEXTS]]. Non-secure endpoints will be ignored.

  No parameters are defined for <a>endpoints</a>, and any parameters which are
  specified will be silently ignored.

  The header is represented by the following ABNF grammar [[!RFC5234]]:

  <pre class="abnf" link-type="grammar" dfn-type="grammar">
    Reporting-Endpoints = <a>sh-dictionary</a>
  </pre>

  <h3 id="process-header" algorithm>
    Process reporting endpoints for |response|
  </h3>

  Given a <a>response</a> (|response|), this algorithm extracts and returns a
  list of <a>endpoints</a>.

  Note: This algorithm is called from around step 13 of <a>main fetch</a>
  [[FETCH]].

  ISSUE: Fetch monkey patching. Talk to Anne.

  1.  Abort these steps if any of the following conditions are true:

      1.  |response|'s <a for="response" attribute>HTTPS state</a> is not
          "`modern`", and the <a lt="origin of a url">origin</a> of |response|'s
          <a for="response" attribute>url</a> is not <a>potentially
          trustworthy</a>.

      2.  |response|'s <a for="response" attribute>header list</a> does not
          contain a <a>header</a> whose <a for="header" attribute>name</a> is
          "<a>`Reporting-Endpoints`</a>".

  2.  Let |header| be the <a for="header" attribute>value</a> of the
      <a>header</a> in |response|'s <a for="response" attribute>header list</a>
      whose name is "<a>`Reporting-Endpoints`</a>".

  3.  Let |parsed header| be the result of executing the algorithm defined in
      Section 4.2 of [[STRUCTURED-HEADERS]] on |header|, with <var
      ignore>header_type</var> set to "dictionary". If that algorithm fails
      parsing, abort these steps.

  4.  Let |endpoints| be an empty list.

  5.  For each |name| → |value_and_parameters| of |parsed header|:


      1.  Let |endpoint url string| be the first element of the tuple
          |value_and_parameters|. If |endpoint url string| is not a string,
          then <a>continue</a>.

      2.  Let |endpoint url| be the result of executing the <a>URL parser</a>
          on |endpoint url string|, with <a spec="url">base URL</a> set to
          |response|'s <a for="response" attribute>url</a>. If |endpoint url| is
          failure, then <a>continue</a>.

      3. If |endpoint url|'s <a>origin</a> is not <a>potentially
          trustworthy</a>, then <a>continue</a>.

      4.  Let |endpoint| be a new <a>endpoint</a> whose properties are set
              as follows:

              :   {{endpoint/name}}
              ::  |name|
              :   {{endpoint/url}}
              ::  |endpoint url|
              :   {{endpoint/failures}}
              ::  0

      5.  Add |endpoint| to |endpoints|.

  6. Return |endpoints|.

  <h3 id="report-generation">Report Generation</h3>

  <h4 id="generate-report" export algorithm>Generate report of |type| with
  |data|</h4>

  When the user agent is to <dfn>generate a report</dfn> for a <a>Document</a>
  (|document|), given a string (|type|), another string (|destination|), and
  a serializable object (|data|), it must run the following steps:

  1.  Let |settings| be |document|'s [=environment settings object=].

  2.  Let |report| be the result of running [[#queue-report]] with |data|,
      |type|, |endpoint| and |settings|.

  3. Append |report| to |document|'s [=reports=].

  <h3 id="report-delivery">Report Delivery</h3>

  Over time, various features will queue up a list of <a>reports</a> for a
  document. The user agent will periodically grab the list of currently queued
  reports, and deliver them to the associated endpoints. This document does not
  define a schedule for the user agent to follow, and assumes that the user
  agent will have enough contextual information to deliver reports in a timely
  manner, balanced against impacting a user's experience.

  That said, a user agent SHOULD make an effort to deliver reports as soon as
  possible after queuing, as a report's data might be significantly more useful
  in the period directly after its generation than it would be a day or a week
  later.

  <h4 id="send-reports" algorithm>Send reports</h4>

  A user agent sends a list of <a>reports</a> (|reports|) for a <a>document</a>
  (|document|) by executing the following steps:

  1.  Let |endpoint map| be an empty map of <a>endpoint</a> objects to lists of
      <a>report</a> objects.

  2.  For each |report| in |reports|:

      1.  If there exists an <a>endpoint</a> (|endpoint|) in |document|'s
          {{document/endpoints}} list whose {{endpoint/name}} is |report|'s
          [=report/destination=]:

          1.  Append |report| to |endpoint map|'s list of reports for
              |endpoint|.

          2. Otherwise, remove |report| from |reports|.

  3.  For each (|endpoint|, |report list|) pair in |endpoint map|:

      1.  Let |origin map| be an empty map of <a spec="html">origins</a> to
          lists of <a>report</a> objects.

      2.  For each |report| in |report list|:

          1.  Let |origin| be the <a>origin</a> of |report|'s [=report/url=].

          2.  Append |report| to |origin map|'s list of reports for |origin|.

      3.  For each (|origin|, |per-origin reports|) pair in |origin map|,
          execute the following steps asynchronously:

          1.  Let |result| be the result of executing [[#try-delivery]] on
              |endpoint|, |origin|, and |per-origin reports|.

          2.  If |result| is "`Failure`":

              1.  Increment |endpoint|'s {{endpoint/failures}}.

          3.  If |result| is "`Remove Endpoint`":

              1.  Remove |endpoint| from |document|'s {{document/endpoints}}
                  list.

          4.  Remove each <a>report</a> from |reports|.

          ISSUE: We don't specify any retry mechanism here for failed reports.
          We may want to add one here, or provide some indication that the
          delivery failed.

  Note: User agents MAY decide to attempt delivery for only a subset of the
  collected reports or endpoints (because, for example, sending all the reports
  at once would consume an unreasonable amount of bandwidth, etc). As reports
  are only removed from the cache after delivery has been attempted, skipped
  reports will simply be delivered later.

  <h4 id="try-delivery" algorithm>
    Attempt to deliver |reports| to |endpoint|
  </h4>

  Given an <a>endpoint</a> (|endpoint|), an <a spec="html">origin</a>
  (|origin|), and a list of <a>reports</a> (|reports|), this algorithm will
  construct a <a>request</a>, and attempt to deliver it to |endpoint|. It
  returns "`Success`" if that delivery succeeds, "`Remove Endpoint`" if the
  endpoint explicitly removes itself as a reporting endpoint by sending a 410
  response, and "`Failure`" otherwise.


  1.  Let |body| be the result of executing [=serialize a list of reports to
      JSON=] on |reports|.

  2.  Let |request| be a new <a>request</a> with the following properties
      [[FETCH]]:

      :   `url`
      ::  |endpoint|'s {{endpoint/url}}
      :   `origin`
      ::  |origin|
      :   `header list`
      ::  A new <a>header list</a> containing a <a>header</a> named
          "`Content-Type`" whose value is "`application/reports+json`"
      :   `client`
      ::  `null`
      :   `window`
      ::  "`no-window`"
      :   `service-worker mode`
      ::  "`none`"
      :   `initiator`
      ::  ""
      :   `destination`
      ::  "`report`"
      :   `mode`
      ::  "`cors`"
      :   `unsafe-request` flag
      ::  set
      :   `credentials`
      ::  "`include`"
      :   `body`
      ::  A [=/body=] whose [=body/source=] is |body|.

  4.  <a>Queue a task</a> to <a>fetch</a> |request|.

  5.  <a>Wait for a response</a> (|response|).

  6.  If |response|'s `status` is an <a>OK status</a> (200-299), return
      "`Success`".

  7.  If |response|'s `status` is `410 Gone` [[!RFC7231]], return "`Remove
      Endpoint`".

  8.  Return "`Failure`".

  <h2 id="observers">Reporting Observers</h2>

  A <dfn>reporting observer</dfn> observes some types of <a>reports</a> from
  JavaScript, and is represented in JavaScript by the {{ReportingObserver}}
  object.

  Each <a spec=ecmascript lt=realm>ECMAScript global environment</a> has
  a <dfn>registered reporting observer list</dfn>, which is an <a>ordered
  set</a> of <a>reporting observers</a>.

  Any <a>reporting observer</a> that is in a <a>registered reporting observer
  list</a> is considered <dfn>registered</dfn>.

  Each <a spec=ecmascript lt=realm>ECMAScript global environment</a> has
  a <dfn>report buffer</dfn>, which is a <a spec=infra>list</a>
  of <a>reports</a> that have been generated in that <a spec=ecmascript
  lt=realm>ECMAScript global environment</a>. This list is initially empty, and
  the reports are stored in the same order in which they are generated.

  Note: The purpose of the <a>report buffer</a> is to allow <a>reporting
  observers</a> to observe reports that were generated earlier than that
  observer could be created (via the {{buffered}} option). For example, some
  reports might be generated during an earlier stage of page loading than when
  an observer could first be created, or before a JavaScript library is loaded
  that wishes to observe these reports.

  Note: </a>Reporting observers</a> are only relevant for user agents with
  JavaScript engines.

  <h3 id=interface-reporting-observer>Interface {{ReportingObserver}}</h3>

dictionary ReportingObserverOptions {
  sequence&lt;DOMString> types;
  boolean buffered = false;
};

typedef sequence&lt;Report> ReportList;
  </pre>

  A <dfn id=dom-report interface>Report</dfn> is the application exposed
  representation of a <a>report</a>. <dfn attribute for="Report">type</dfn>
  returns [=report/type=], <dfn attribute for="Report">url</dfn> returns
  [=report/url=], and <dfn attribute for="Report">body</dfn> returns
  [=report/body=].

  Each {{ReportingObserver}} object has these associated concepts:
    - A <dfn for=ReportingObserver>callback</dfn> function set on creation.
    - A {{ReportingObserverOptions}} dictionary called
      <dfn for=ReportingObserver>options</dfn>.
    - A list of {{Report}} objects called the <dfn for=ReportingObserver>report
      queue</dfn>, which is initially empty.

  A {{ReportList}} represents a sequence of {{Report}}s, providing developers
  with all the convenience methods found on JavaScript arrays.

  The <dfn constructor for=ReportingObserver><code>
  ReportingObserver(|callback|, |options|)</code></dfn> constructor, when
  invoked, must run these steps:

  1. Create a new {{ReportingObserver}} object |observer|.

  2. Set |observer|'s <a>callback</a> to |callback|.

  3. Set |observer|'s <a>options</a> to |options|.

  4. Return |observer|.

  The <dfn method for=ReportingObserver><code>observe()</code></dfn>
  method, when invoked, must run these steps:

  1. Let |environment| be the <a spec=ecmascript lt=realm>ECMAScript global
     environment</a> associated with the <a>context object</a>.

  2. Append the <a>context object</a> to the <a>registered reporting observer
     list</a> of its associated <a spec=ecmascript lt=realm>ECMAScript global
     environment</a>.

  3. If the <a>context object</a>'s {{buffered}} <a>option</a> is false, return.

  4. Set <a>context object</a>'s {{buffered}} <a>option</a> to false.

  5. For each |report| in the <a>report buffer</a> associated with
     |environment|, <a>queue a task</a> to execute [[#add-report]] with |report|
     and the <a>context object</a>.

  The <dfn method for=ReportingObserver><code>disconnect()</code></dfn> method,
  when invoked, must run these steps:

  1. If the <a>context object</a> is not <a>registered</a>, return.

  2. Remove the <a>context object</a> from the <a>registered reporting observer
     list</a> of its associated <a spec=ecmascript lt=realm>ECMAScript global
     environment</a>.

  The <dfn method for=ReportingObserver><code>takeRecords()</code></dfn> method,
  when invoked, must run these steps:

  1. Let |reports| be a copy of the <a>context object</a>'s <a>report queue</a>.

  2. Empty the <a>context object</a>'s <a>report queue</a>.

  3. Return |reports|.

  <h3 id="notify-observers" algorithm>
    Notify reporting observers on |environment| with |report|
  </h3>

  This algorithm makes |report|'s contents available to any <a>registered</a>
  <a>reporting observers</a> on the provided <a spec=ecmascript
  lt=realm>ECMAScript global environment</a> |environment|.

  1. For each {{ReportingObserver}} |observer| <a>registered</a> with
     |environment|, execute [[#add-report]] on |report| and |observer|.

  2. Append |report| to the <a>report buffer</a> associated with |environment|.

  3. Let |type| be |report|'s <a>type</a>.

  4. If the <a>report buffer</a> now contains more than 100 reports
     with <a>type</a> equal to |type|, remove the earliest item with <a>type</a>
     equal to |type| in the <a>report buffer</a>.

  <h3 id="add-report" algorithm>
    Add |report| to |observer|
  </h3>

  Given a <a>report</a> |report| and a {{ReportingObserver}} |observer|, this
  algorithm adds |report| to |observer|'s <a>report queue</a>, so long as
  |report|'s <a>type</a> is observable by |observer|.

  1. If |report|'s [=report/type=] is not <a>visible to
    <code>ReportingObserver</code>s</a>, return.

  2. If |observer|'s <a>options</a> has a non-empty
     {{ReportingObserverOptions/types}} member which does not contain |report|'s
     [=report/type=], return.

  3. Create a new {{Report}} |r| with {{Report/type}} initialized to |report|'s
     [=report/type=], {{Report/url}} initialized to |report|'s [=report/url=],
     and {{Report/body}} initialized to |report|'s [=report/body=].

  Issue: how to polymorphically initialize body?

  3. Append |r| to |observer|'s <a>report queue</a>.

  4. If the size of |observer|'s <a>report queue</a> is 1, <a>Queue a task</a>
     to [[#invoke-observers]] with a copy of the <a>registered reporting
     observer list</a> of the <a spec=ecmascript lt=realm>ECMAScript global
     environment</a> associated with |observer|.

  <h3 id="invoke-observers" algorthm>
    Invoke reporting observers with |notify list|
  </h3>

  This algorithm invokes observer callback functions for reports of previously
  observed behavior.

  1. For each {{ReportingObserver}} |observer| in |notify list|:

     1. If |observer|'s <a>report queue</a> is empty, then continue.

     2. Let |reports| be a copy of |observer|'s <a>report queue</a>

     3. Empty |observer|'s <a>report queue</a>

     4. <a spec=webidl>Invoke</a> |observer|'s <a>callback</a> with a list of
        arguments consisting of |reports| and |observer|, and |observer| as the
        <a>callback this value</a>.  If this throws an exception, <a>report the
        exception</a>.

  <h2 id="implementation">Implementation Considerations</h2>

  <h3 id="delivery">Delivery</h3>

  The user agent SHOULD attempt to deliver reports as soon as possible to
  provide feedback to developers as quickly as possible. However, when this
  desire is balanced against the impact on the user, the user wins. With that
  in mind, the user agent MAY delay delivery of reports based on its knowledge
  of the user's activities and context.

  For instance, the user agent SHOULD prioritize the transmission of reporting
  data lower than other network traffic. The user's explicit activities on a
  website should preempt reporting traffic.

  The user agent MAY choose to withhold report delivery entirely until the user
  is on a fast, cheap network in order to prevent unnecessary data cost.

  The user agent MAY choose to prioritize reports from particular origins over
  others (perhaps those that the user visits most often?)

  <h3 id="gc">Garbage Collection</h3>

  Periodically, the user agent SHOULD walk through the cached <a>reports</a>
  and <a data-lt="endpoint">endpoints</a>, and discard those that are no longer
  relevant. These include:

  *   <a data-lt="endpoint">endpoints</a> whose {{endpoint/failures}} exceed
      some user-agent-defined threshold (~5 seems reasonable)
  *   <a>reports</a> which have not been delivered in some arbitrary period of
      time (perhaps ~2 days?)

  For any <a>reports</a> that are discarded, these <a>reports</a> should also be
  removed from the <a>report buffer</a> of any <a>reporting observer</a>.

  <h2 id="automation">Automation</h2>

  For the purposes of user-agent automation and application testing, this
  document defines a number of <a>extension commands</a> for the [[WebDriver]]
  specification.

  <h3 id="generate-test-report-command">Generate Test Report</h3>

  The <dfn>Generate Test Report</dfn> <a>extension command</a> simulates the
  generation of a <a>report</a> for the purposes of testing. This report will be
  observed by any <a>registered</a> <a>reporting observers</a>.

  The <a>extension command</a> is defined as follows:

  <pre class='idl'>
    dictionary GenerateTestReportParameters {
      required DOMString message;
      DOMString group = "default";
    };
  </pre>

  <table style="border-spacing: 20px 0px;">
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <th>HTTP Method</th>
        <th><a lt="extension command uri template">URI Template</a></th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>`POST`</td>
        <td>`/session/{session id}/reporting/generate_test_report`</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  The <a>remote end steps</a> are:

  1. If |parameters| is not a JSON <a>Object</a>, return a <a>WebDriver
     error</a> with <a>WebDriver error code</a> <a>invalid argument</a>.

  2. Let |message| be the result of <a>trying</a> to get |parameters|'s
     {{GenerateTestReportParameters/message}} property.

  3. If |message| is not present, return a <a>WebDriver error</a>
     with <a>WebDriver error code</a> <a>invalid argument</a>.

  4. If the <a>current browsing context</a> is no longer open, return a
     <a>WebDriver error</a> with <a>WebDriver error code</a> <a>no such
     window</a>.

  5. <a>Handle any user prompts</a> and return its value if it is a <a>WebDriver
     error</a>.

  6. Let |group| be |parameters|'s {{GenerateTestReportParameters/group}}
     property.

  7. Let |body| be a new object that can be serialized into a <a>JSON text</a>,
     containing a single string field, |body_message|.

  8. Set |body_message| to |message|.

  9. Let |settings| be the <a>environment settings object</a> of the
     <a>current browsing context</a>'s <a>active document</a>.

  10. Execute [[#queue-report]] with |body|, "test", |group|, and |settings|.

  11. Return <a>success</a> with data null.

  <h2 id="security">Security Considerations</h2>

  <h3 id="capability-urls">Capability URLs</h3>

  Some URLs are valuable in and of themselves. To mitigate the possibility
  that such URLs will be leaked via this reporting mechanism, we strip out
  credential information and fragment data from the URL we store as a
  <a>report</a>'s originator. It is still possible, however, for a feature
  to unintentionally leak such data via a report's [=report/body=]. Implementers
  SHOULD ensure that URLs contained in a report's body are similarly stripped.
</section>

<section>
  <h2 id="privacy">Privacy Considerations</h2>

  <h3 id="network-leakage">Network Leakage</h3>

  Because there is a delay between a page being loaded and a report being
  generated and sent, it's entirely possible for a report generated while a user
  is on one network to be sent while the user is on another network.

  This behaviour is limited to the lifetime of the document which generated the
  reports, though, and such a document could be generating traffic on the new
  network through other means in any case, even after the document is closed,
  through mechanisms such as `navigator.sendBeacon`.

  ISSUE(w3c/BackgroundSync#107): Consider mitigations. For example, we could
  drop reports if we change from one network to another.

  <h3 id="fingerprinting-clock-skew">Clock Skew</h3>

  Each report is delivered along with an `age` property, rather than the
  timestamp at which it was generated. We do this because each user's local
  clock will be skewed from the clock on the server by an arbitrary amount.
  The difference between the time the report was generated and the time it
  was sent will be stable, regardless of clock skew, and we can avoid the
  fingerprinting risk of exposing the clock skew via this API.

  <h3 id="correlation">Cross-origin correlation</h3>

  If multiple origins all use the same reporting endpoint, that endpoint may
  learn that a particular user has interacted with a certain set of websites,
  as it will receive origin-tagged reports from each. This doesn't seem worse
  than the status quo ability to track the same information from cooperative
  origins, and doesn't grant any new tracking ability above and beyond what's
  possible with `<img>` today.

  <h3 id="disable">Disabling Reporting</h3>

  Reporting is, to some extent, a question of commons. In the aggregate, it
  seems useful for everyone for reports to be delivered. There is direct benefit
  to developers, as they can fix bugs, which means there's indirect benefit to
  users, as the sites they enjoy will be more stable and enjoyable. As a
  concrete example, Content Security Policy grants something like herd immunity
  to cross-site scripting attacks by alerting developers about potential holes
  in their sites' defenses. Fixing those bugs helps every user, even those whose
  user agents don't support Content Security Policy.

  The calculus, of course, depends on the nature of data that's being delivered,
  and the relative maliciousness of the reporting endpoints, but that's the
  value proposition in broad strokes.

  That said, it can't be the case that this general benefit be allowed to take
  priority over the ability of a user to individually opt-out of such a system.
  Sending reports costs bandwidth, and potentially could reveal some small
  amount of additional information above and beyond what a website can obtain
  in-band ([[NETWORK-ERROR-LOGGING]], for instance). User agents MUST allow
  users to disable reporting with some reasonable amount of granularity in order
  to maintain the priority of constituencies espoused in
  [[HTML-DESIGN-PRINCIPLES]].
